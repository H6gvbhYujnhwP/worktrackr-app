# WorkTrackr — CRM, Ordering & Commission Roadmap (v4.2)

**Status:** Living document. Phase 0 (IdoYourQuotes integration) is built, deployed and working in production. The quote→order/contract **cost/profit/type pull** is **confirmed live end-to-end** (v2.2): the IDYQ-repo `worktrackrBridge.ts` `mapLine` emits `cost_price`/`profit`/`pricing_type`, the WorkTrackr mirror stores them, and a pulled line shows real buy-in cost + profit (verified on the Headway quote — Microsoft 365 came through at £8.57 cost / £39.26 line profit, monthly/annual line types tagged). **Refresh-on-pull (v2.2):** the order/contract "Pull" now re-syncs that one quote from IdoYourQuotes before reading the mirror, so a pull is always current (no manual "Sync quotes" needed); the 30-min scheduled sweep still keeps everything warm. **Picker refresh (v2.3):** the order/contract quote picker also background-refreshes on open (`GET /api/idyq/quotes?refresh=1`), so a brand-new IdoYourQuotes quote appears in the dropdown within a second of opening the form — the cached list shows instantly, then updates. **Phases 1–5 are BUILT** (company-centred records + IA regroup; contacts/history/tasks; the full Orders module with approval/purchasing/fulfilment queues; the fully-configurable commission engine + engineer wage progression; IDYQ act-on-quote + recurring Contracts + recurring commission). **Phase 6 (slim) was built** (a simple Deals list + CSV company import) but the **Deals concept has since been reframed as Leads** (see Phase 7). **Phase 7 — Leads — is COMPLETE** (the old "Deals" tab is now a company-centred chase list: the sales stage *Suspect* was renamed *New*; a Leads screen with phone/email/contact columns, sortable headers, stage chips, search, "Mine only" and a first-contact + chase-date column in UK format; an Add-lead quick form; a guided **Convert to customer**; confirmed-delete-to-**archive** with a manager-only Archived view; and a slide-over **Notes panel** with email drag-in). **Phase 8 — sidebar consolidation — is COMPLETE** (the seven Sales items collapsed into a single **Sales** entry with five tabs — Companies/Leads/Quotes/Orders/Contracts; **Approvals** moved to Workspace; the two calendars merged into one **blended Calendar** showing jobs, scheduled tickets, meetings and follow-ups on one month grid with source toggles). NO hardcoded money anywhere (every commission/bonus/threshold/rate is per-org config, zero by default). See §15 (START HERE) and §14.14–§14.18. **Phase 8.1 — Sales UX consolidation (v2.1) is COMPLETE** (one shared `SalesPageLayout` chrome so every Sales tab matches the Leads look; the **Quotes** tab now shows only a quotes list — read-only IdoYourQuotes when connected, the org's native quotes otherwise — with the old CRM stat-cards + inner sub-tabs gone; **Leads** folded onto the shared chrome; the standalone **CRM settings** and **Catalogue** screens stripped to single-section (no mega-page chrome); **Catalogue** menu item hidden when IdoYourQuotes is connected; a sixth **Calendar** tab added to Sales showing the blended calendar pre-scoped to sales activity). See §14.19. Remaining: deferred non-blockers only (IDYQ tag/bridge sync; deferred CRM "Customers" tab + ticket→company click-through; Xero/QuickBooks later; optional store-the-original-email-file for the Notes panel). **v2.4: `memberships.role` widened** to allow `salesman`/`engineer` (migration `phase9_widen_membership_roles.sql` + `database/schema.sql`) — the gate for the Users role selector + role-based home screens, which are the remaining build on top of it. **v2.4: dead files removed** (orphaned Deals UI + route, all `*.broken`/`*.backup` clutter).

**Last updated:** 2026-06-23 · **Version history:** v1.0 baseline → v1.1 (menu-consolidation analysis) → v1.2 (revised IA) → v1.3 (IA consolidation) → v1.4 (company-profile services panel) → v1.5 (Phase 5 complete) → v1.6 (Phase 6 design) → v1.7 (Phase 6 slimmed; Deals built) → v1.8 (CSV import built) → v1.9 (docs refreshed for new-session handoff) → **v2.0** (Phase 7 Leads: "Deals"→company-centred Leads chase list, stage *Suspect*→*New*, Add-lead, guided Convert-to-customer, delete→archive, slide-over Notes panel with email drag-in; Phase 8 sidebar consolidation: single tabbed **Sales** entry, **Approvals**→Workspace, one **blended Calendar**) → **v2.1** (Sales UX consolidation: shared `SalesPageLayout` across all Sales tabs; Quotes tab = quotes-list-only, IDYQ-when-connected-else-native; Leads folded onto the shared chrome; CRM settings + Catalogue screens single-section; Catalogue hidden when IDYQ connected; new sixth **Calendar** tab in Sales, sales-scoped) → **v2.2** (IDYQ cost/profit/type pull confirmed live end-to-end; **refresh-on-pull** — order/contract Pull re-syncs the quote first so it's always current) → **v2.3** (quote **picker refresh** — order/contract quote dropdown background-refreshes on open so brand-new quotes appear without a manual sync) → **v2.4** (`memberships.role` widened to add `salesman`/`engineer` — migration + schema; dead-file cleanup: orphaned Deals UI/route + all `*.broken`/`*.backup` files removed)

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for the WorkTrackr sales/CRM redesign and the IdoYourQuotes (IDYQ) integration. Captures everything discussed so the work survives any loss of chat history. Nothing here should be assumed "done" unless it is under "Phase 0 — already built".

---

## 1. Vision & guiding principles

WorkTrackr is becoming a **company-centred CRM + ordering + commission system**, marketed to **all business sectors** (not just IT/MSP). Every design choice must therefore be:

- **Company-centred.** The company/customer record is the centre of the CRM. Contacts, tasks, notes, history, orders, deals and services all link back to the company. (In the current DB a "company" is a `contacts` row of type `company` — the old `customers` table was dropped in the customers→contacts merge.)
- **Pipeline-driven.** Companies move through sales stages: **Suspect → Prospect → Hot Prospect → Customer**. A salesperson can filter to their Hot Prospects and see who to revisit to get a deal over the line. Winning a deal converts it into a proper sale (an Order).
- **🚫 NO HARDCODED MONEY RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE.** This is a **production, multi-tenant app for many organisations**. **No** commission rate, bonus rate, profit-share, deduction/internal-cost, threshold, period boundary, or any other money figure is ever written into code. Every such value is **per-organisation configuration**, entered by that org in an admin area and stored in the database. The app ships **neutral** (everything zero/disabled); an org that hasn't configured a scheme gets zeros, never someone else's numbers. Any specific schedule an organisation uses is **only an example it types in**, and must **never** appear as a default, constant, or fallback in code. Reviewers: a literal rate/amount in a `.js`/`.sql` file is a bug.
- **Configurable / multi-sector.** Commission rules, the order form's purchasing fields, and per-role screens must be configurable and switch-off-able. Use neutral terms ("Orders", "Contracts") rather than IT-specific language. Any organisation's commission scheme is *one configured ruleset typed in by that org*, not hard-coded behaviour.
- **Two delivery branches.** (A) **One-off jobs** = an Order Form created in WorkTrackr (purchasing/margin sheet). (B) **Recurring IT support/services** = Contracts that originate from IDYQ quotes.
- **Role-appropriate visibility.** Sales staff see commission/bonus. Engineers must **never** see per-company deal profit — they see a wage-progression screen instead (see §8).

## 2. Phase 0 — IdoYourQuotes (IDYQ) integration — ALREADY BUILT & LIVE

A read-only, server-to-server bridge that lets WorkTrackr pull IDYQ's catalogue and quotes. Built, deployed to both Render apps, and tested end-to-end.

### 2.1 The two apps
- **WorkTrackr** — `worktrackr-app`, domain `worktrackr.cloud`. Node 20 + Express, CommonJS, PostgreSQL via `pg`, npm workspaces (`web` / `worker` / `shared`). React/Vite client. The `web` service auto-runs migrations on startup (`web/run-migrations.js` scans `web/migrations/*.sql`, tracks them in `schema_migrations`, runs alphabetically in transactions). DB helpers in `shared/db.js` (`query`, `transaction`, `getOrgContext`). Multi-tenant by `organisations`; routes use `req.orgContext.organizationId`; cookie auth (`authenticateToken`).
- **IDYQ (IdoYourQuotes)** — `idoyourquotes-main`, app domain `wedoyourquotes.com` (alias `idoyourquotes.com`). TypeScript ESM, Drizzle ORM, Express + tRPC, pnpm, esbuild. **Entry point is `server/_core/index.ts`** (NOT `server/index.ts`, which is a stale duplicate). DB helpers in `server/db.ts`; runtime schema in `drizzle/schema.ts`.

Both repos are owned by GitHub account `H6gvbhYujnhwP`; the user pushes via GitHub Desktop from `C:\repo` on Windows. Render auto-deploys on push.

### 2.2 Design decision
Read-only **PULL** from WorkTrackr → IDYQ. WorkTrackr keeps **mirror tables** (separate from its own native products/quotes). Per-organisation **opt-in** connection. IDYQ remains the single source of truth for quote/catalogue content.

### 2.3 Signing scheme (HMAC) — proven working both directions
- Payload string = `<expiryUnixSeconds>.<nonce>.<METHOD>.<PATH>` where PATH is the path only (NO query string; `SIGN_INCLUDES_QUERY=false`).
- HMAC-SHA256 with the shared secret → lowercase hex.
- Sent as header `X-WT-Signature: <expiry>.<nonce>.<hmac>`, ~90s expiry (IDYQ accepts up to `now + 130s`).
- IDYQ verifies constant-time, checks expiry, returns 403 (invalid) / 400 (missing org).

### 2.4 Per-org scoping
- WorkTrackr sends `X-WT-Org: <idyq-org-slug-or-id>` on every request.
- Stored per WorkTrackr org in `idyq_connection.idyq_org_ref`, set at connect time.
- IDYQ resolves slug or numeric id → org and scopes all data to it.
- **Security follow-up (before onboarding 3rd-party customers):** any secret-holder can currently request any org via the header. Needs an allow-list. (Tracked in §11.)

### 2.5 Environment variables (set in Render, confirmed)
- **WorkTrackr (web + worker):** `WORKTRACKR_BRIDGE_SECRET`, `IDYQ_BASE_URL=https://idoyourquotes.com`. Optional: `IDYQ_BRIDGE_EXPIRY_SECONDS` (default 90), `IDYQ_SYNC_CRON` (default `*/30 * * * *`).
- **IDYQ:** `WORKTRACKR_BRIDGE_SECRET` (same value; kept separate from the pre-existing `STUDIO_BRIDGE_SECRET`). No admin-email var (per-org-header approach is used instead).

### 2.6 IDYQ-side files (deployed)
- `server/_core/worktrackrBridge.ts` (NEW) — `registerWorktrackrBridge(app)`. Verifies `X-WT-Signature`, scopes via `X-WT-Org` → `getOrganizationById/BySlug`. Serves:
  - `GET /api/external/catalogue`
  - `GET /api/external/quotes`
  - `GET /api/external/quotes/:id`
  - Returns `{ products|quotes: [...], page, page_size, total, total_pages, has_more }` and `{ quote: {...} }`. Uses `res.x(); return;` convention (not `return res.x()`) for TS strictness.
- `server/_core/index.ts` (EDITED) — imports and calls `registerWorktrackrBridge(app)` before the tRPC mount.

### 2.7 WorkTrackr-side files (deployed)
- Migrations:
  - `web/migrations/create_idyq_integration_tables.sql` — creates `idyq_connection`, `idyq_products`, `idyq_quotes`, `idyq_quote_lines`, `idyq_sync_state`. `idyq_quotes.linked_contact_id` FK → `contacts` (WorkTrackr-only quote↔contact link). **No `customers` FK** (that was the original deploy-breaking bug; fixed).
  - `web/migrations/idyq_add_org_ref.sql` — adds `idyq_connection.idyq_org_ref`.
  - `web/migrations/idyq_catalogue_fields.sql` — adds `idyq_products.unit`, `cost_price`, `install_hours`, `pricing_type` (ALTER … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS).
- `shared/idyq/idyqClient.js` — `idyqGet(path, query, opts)` signs requests and sets `X-WT-Org` from `opts.orgRef`. Exports `buildSignatureHeader`, `getConfig`.
- `shared/idyq/idyqSync.js` — `syncCatalogue`, `fetchCatalogueLive` (all pages, raw IDYQ objects, for live read-through), `pullQuotes`, `pullQuoteByNumber`, `syncAllConnectedOrgs`, `getOrgRef`. Idempotent upsert by `(organisation_id, idyq_id)`; quote lines replaced per-quote (IDYQ lines have no stable id).
- `shared/idyq/index.js` — re-exports client + sync.
- `web/routes/idyq.js` — mounted at `/api/idyq`. Endpoints:
  - `GET/POST /connection`, `POST /connection/connect {idyqOrgRef}`, `POST /connection/disconnect`
  - `POST /sync/catalogue`, `POST /sync/quotes`, `POST /pull/quote`
  - `GET /catalogue` — **LIVE read-through** via `fetchCatalogueLive` (always current, incl. deletes), falls back to the mirror if IDYQ is unreachable (returns `live:false, stale:true`).
  - `GET /quotes`, `GET /quotes/:idyqId`, `POST /quotes/:idyqId/link {contactId}`
  - Mappers: `mapProduct` (mirror row), `mapLiveProduct` (live IDYQ shape), `mapQuote`.
- `worker/worker.js` (EDITED) — pg-boss schedule `idyq-sync` every 30 min → `syncAllConnectedOrgs` (keeps the mirror warm as a fallback; the catalogue *display* is live regardless).
- `web/server.js` (EDITED) — mounts `/api/idyq`.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/IdyqIntegration.jsx` (NEW) — `useIdyqConnection` hook, `IdyqCatalogView` (grouped by category, collapsible, search, Refresh, Expand/Collapse all, live indicator), `IdyqQuotesView` (read-only, expandable line items), `IdyqConnectionPanel` (connect/disconnect/sync, org slug input).
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/CRMDashboard.jsx` (EDITED, 6 splices) — calls the hook; tab labels gain "· IDYQ"; Quote Templates hidden when connected; Catalog & Quotes tabs swap to the IDYQ views when connected; `IdyqConnectionPanel` added to CRM Settings.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` (EDITED) — readability fix: inactive nav text `#999`→`#e5e7eb` (hover white); section labels (MAIN/CRM/ACCOUNT) `#555`→`#9ca3af`.

### 2.8 Data-model mapping (IDYQ → WorkTrackr)
**Catalogue items** (`catalogItems`): `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `unit`, `defaultRate` → `unit_price` (sell ex-VAT), `costPrice` → `cost_price` (buy-in ex-VAT), `installTimeHrs` → `install_hours`, `pricingType` ('standard'|'monthly') → `pricing_type`, `isActive` (0/1) → `active`. No SKU, no per-item VAT, no currency (hardcoded GBP). Connected catalogue display = **live read-through** (always current).

**Quotes** (`quotes`): `id`, `reference` → `quote_number`, `status`, `total`, `clientName`/`clientEmail` (flat customer; company = `clientName`), `createdAt`/`updatedAt`. No currency (GBP). Line items (`quoteLineItems`): `description`, `quantity` → `qty`, `rate` → `unit_price`, `total` → `line_total`; no product link.

### 2.9 Validation done
All JS `node --check`'d; TS esbuild-transpiled clean. HMAC round-trip + negative tests (tampered path, wrong secret, expired) correct. End-to-end LIVE pull from the WorkTrackr web shell returned the real Sweetbyte catalogue (62 items confirmed in UI). DB tables verified via psql.

### 2.10 IDYQ org slugs (from the DB)
- **Sweetbyte Ltd** = `sweetbyte-ltd-mo5yzrt7` (id 10) — **the live org in use**.
- The Green Agents = `the-green-agents-movpegq1` (id 12).
- Test orgs: `wez-org` (3), `john-org` (4), `wez-and-nic` (13).

### 2.11 "Editable IDYQ" — clarified meaning
The user does **not** want to edit IDYQ quote content from WorkTrackr. "Editable" means: **bring all profit fields across** (sell, buy-in/cost, margin) so WorkTrackr shows each company's services and the **monthly profit** we make — which drives commission/bonus. Beyond data, WorkTrackr should be able to **act on** an IDYQ quote (mark won, convert to Contract/Job, link to a company, set a WorkTrackr-side status) while the quote text stays in IDYQ. (Largely delivered for catalogue/profit; "act on quote" + Contracts is Phase 4.)

---

## 3. Target sales flow (the pipeline)

```
Prospect (telesales — James Edgar)
  → Meeting (notes / phone recording → into IDYQ)
    → Opportunity (linked to Company + sales rep)
      ├── One-off job  → Order Form (items, supplier URL, cost, profit)      [WorkTrackr]
      └── Recurring    → Contract (from IdoYourQuotes quote)                  [IDYQ]
          → Manager approval (approve / order)
            → Purchase / provision
              → Invoice raised (in the customer's accounts system; flagged here)
                → Paid (flagged here)
                  → Commission calculated (engine; only when paid) → manager approve → payroll
```

Two flows, one finance pipeline. The split (one-off purchasing vs recurring contracts) is the core distinction.

---

## 4. Information architecture (new sidebar)

> ⚠️ **Superseded by §4.1.** The grouping below was the Phase-1 plan, written before Orders, Contracts, commission, wage and approvals screens existed. The live menu has since grown past it (see §4.1 for the consolidation plan).

The current flat 15-item menu is being regrouped to follow the flow:

- **Sales** — Prospects, Meetings, Opportunities, Orders (one-off), Contracts (recurring)
- **Delivery** — Tickets, Jobs/Projects, Calendar
- **Finance** — Invoicing & Payments, Commissions
- **Contacts** — companies and people
- **Settings** — Catalogue, Commission rules, Integrations (IdoYourQuotes, Xero/QuickBooks), Users (roles), Billing, Security

### 4.1 Menu consolidation pass (PROPOSED — pending approval, v1.1)
By v1.1 the sidebar had grown to ~24 items across 5 sections with real duplication. Findings from the code:
- **`CRMDashboard.jsx` is a tabbed mega-page** (tabs: Customers / Product Catalog / Quotes / CRM Settings) that the sidebar **Quotes** and **Catalogue** items both deep-link into — so the page's tabs mirror sidebar entries and the same screens are reachable 2–3 ways.
- **Three doors to customer data:** sidebar **Companies** (the Phase-1 `CompanyPipelineList`), sidebar **Contacts** (legacy `ContactManager` people list), and the CRM page's **Customers** tab.
- **Personal items scattered** across four sections: My Tasks (Sales), My wage (Delivery), My commission (Finance), My Notes (Contacts).
- **Pay split awkwardly:** personal pay across Delivery (My wage) + Finance (My commission); pay-admin across Delivery (Engineer wages) + Finance (Commission rules).
- **Two calendars verified distinct (v1.2 code check):** `IntegratedCalendar` (view `calendar`) reads `/api/calendar/events` (ticket scheduling); `CRMCalendar` (view `crm-calendar`) reads `/api/crm-events` (meetings/sales activity). They are correctly separate — keep both; only the CRM Calendar's menu item is mis-placed (sits in Delivery).
- **Notes** as top-level items though company notes belong on the company profile.

**Target IA (≈16 items, one shared customer hub) — section order: Workspace → Delivery → Sales → Finance → Settings:**
- **Workspace** (new, everyone) — My Tasks, **My Pay** (My wage + My commission merged; shows whichever applies), My Notes.
- **Delivery** (above Sales) — Tickets, Projects, **Calendar** (tickets & scheduling — `IntegratedCalendar`, `/api/calendar/events`).
- **Sales** — **Companies** (the one shared customer hub — Delivery's tickets link to the same company record via `tickets.contact_id`; ticket view to gain a click-through to the company profile), Quotes, Orders, Contracts, **CRM Calendar** (meetings/sales activity — `CRMCalendar`, `/api/crm-events`; **moved here from Delivery**), Approvals *(mgr)*.
- **Finance** — Invoices.
- **Settings** *(mgr/admin)* — Catalogue, Commission rules, Engineer wages, CRM settings, Pricing, Integrations, Users, Billing, Security, Email Intake.

The standalone **Contacts** and **Company Notes** menu items are removed (people and notes live on the company; Companies is the primary hub). The CRM page's own **Customers** tab is left intact for now so non-IDYQ orgs keep their existing customer/services screens — it is simply no longer a separate sidebar door.

**CRM page deliberately preserved (v1.3 build):** most orgs do **not** use IdoYourQuotes and rely on the native **Quotes / Catalogue / Quote Templates** that replace it, so the CRM page and all its tabs are left fully intact. Consolidation is done at the **sidebar** instead — single clean entries point into the CRM page: **Quotes** (Sales), **Catalogue** and **CRM settings** (Settings). A `singleSection` switch was added to `CRMDashboard` but is **off by default**, so behaviour is unchanged. Built; see §14.11.

---

## 5. Modules & screens

### 5.1 Company-centred CRM
- **Company record:** business name, address, category/status (sales stage), assigned account manager, source, notes, overall activity. Everything links back to it.
- **Sales stages:** Suspect / Prospect / Hot Prospect / Customer — easy to change; lists/dashboards filter by stage.
- **Ownership:** each company has an account manager; managers/admins can reassign and allocate tasks.

### 5.2 Company list / pipeline  (mockup: `crm_company_pipeline_list`)
Filter chips by stage with counts (Suspect/Prospect/Hot Prospect/Customer). Rows show company + stage pill, next action + due (overdue highlighted), monthly value. Search by name/contact/postcode/account manager. This is the salesperson's home — filter to Hot Prospects to see who to revisit.

### 5.3 Company profile  (mockup: `crm_company_profile`)
The hub. Header: name, **changeable status pill**, account manager, source; actions "Mark won" and "New order". Metric cards: monthly profit / active services / open tasks. **"Services & monthly profit"** table (from IDYQ — charge, cost, profit per service + total recurring; read-only, badged "from IdoYourQuotes"). Contacts panel (with decision-maker flag). Recent history timeline.

### 5.4 Contacts, History, Tasks
- **Contacts:** multiple people per company (name, role, email, phone, decision-maker status).
- **History:** audit trail of calls, emails, meetings, notes, order updates, completed tasks, manager comments.
- **Tasks:** title, assigned user, due date, priority, linked company/contact, status. Open + completed both visible; a "my tasks" dashboard rolls them up.

### 5.5 Orders (one-off jobs)
New module — the coral branch. A new order:
- **Always starts blank** (DECISION — no pre-import of existing deals/customers; James starts fresh).
- Picks a Company, then line items with columns: **item, quantity, supplier URL (where we buy it), unit cost, total cost, unit profit, total profit** (auto-calculated).
- **Pull from IdoYourQuotes (DECISION):** an order can pull one or several IDYQ quotes; each pulled line brings its **buy-in cost, profit and type (one-off/annual) straight from that quote**, read-only in WorkTrackr. Margins are changed by editing the quote in IDYQ (the single source of truth, where the customer quote lives) and re-pulling — WorkTrackr never writes back. Manually-added lines are costed in WorkTrackr (editable). The pulled type sets the commission basis (one-off vs recurring), each at the org's own configured rate. This is distinct from a recurring **Contract** (§5.7): pulling a quote into an order is a one-off snapshot; a Contract tracks ongoing monthly profit.
- Records the salesperson (for commission).
- Status workflow: **Draft → Submitted → Approved → Ordered → Invoiced → Paid**, with explicit invoiced and paid flags.
- Purchasing fields (supplier URL, cost) are **optional** (multi-sector — a consultancy has no "where we buy it").

### 5.6 Approval queue & Purchasing queue
- **Approval queue:** managers/admins approve or reject orders and add comments.
- **Purchasing queue:** purchasing users see approved orders, update fulfilment/purchasing status, and write updates back to the order/company history.

### 5.7 Contracts (recurring)
A won IDYQ quote becomes a **Contract** in WorkTrackr with recurring monthly revenue and recurring cost → recurring profit, tracked while the customer is active. Drives recurring commission.

### 5.8 Deals / forecast summary  (lower priority)
Spreadsheet-style forecast: customer, expected profit, monthly premium/charge, likelihood to close, close date, account manager.

### 5.9 CSV import (lower priority)
Import company/contact/source data; create or update records; avoid duplicate companies (dedupe).

---

## 6. Roles, permissions & role-based dashboards

### 6.1 Roles (DECISION — toggle in the Users section)
Four roles, selected per member in the Users screen. Mapped onto the existing `memberships.role` so current users don't break — the live `CHECK (role IN ('admin','manager','staff'))` is widened to add `salesman` and `engineer`:
- **Global Admin** (`admin`) — everything: all records, approvals, commission rules, Users, Billing, Security.
- **Manager** (`manager`) — all dashboards, approval & purchasing queues, approves/rejects orders, configures commission rules and sets manual bonus/wage figures. **Not** Billing/Security/Users (Global-Admin-only).
- **Salesman** (`salesman`, NEW) — owns company records; adds contacts, tasks, history; creates draft orders; sees the "My commission & bonus" screen.
- **Engineer** (`engineer`, NEW) — delivery + the "My wage progression" screen. **Never** sees per-company profit or commission.
- (No separate purchasing role for now — Managers/Global Admins work the purchasing queue. Read-only can be added later.)

### 6.2 Role-based home screens (IMPORTANT visibility rule)
- **Salesman →** "My commission & bonus" screen (§7.3).
- **Engineer →** "My wage progression" screen (§8). **Engineers must NOT see per-company deal profit** or commission figures.

---

## 7. Commission & bonus engine

### 7.1 Principle
A **fully configurable** rules engine (multi-sector, multi-tenant). **NOTHING is hardcoded** (see §1 — non-negotiable). The app ships **neutral**: every rate, deduction, threshold, bonus % and the period boundary default to **zero / disabled**, so an org with no scheme configured gets **zeros**, never another org's numbers. Each organisation enters its **own** ruleset in the admin **Commission rules** area; the engine applies only what that org stored in `commission_settings.config`. The whole module is switch-off-able (`enabled` flag). The rule types in §7.2 carry **no figures**; whatever an org types in is its own, and no rate or amount ever appears as a code default, constant or fallback.

**Phase-4 scope decisions (locked this build):**
- **Recurring commission deferred to Phase 5** — recurring commission belongs to Contracts, which don't exist yet. The `recurringRate` config field exists but is unused until Phase 5.
- **Finance & referral handled now** via a per-order **commission category** (`standard` / `finance` / `referral`) chosen on the order form; the engine applies the org's configured `financeRate` / `referralRate`. `standard` uses `oneOffRate` on `(profit − deductionPerSale)`.
- **Internal cost-before-profit (`deductionPerSale`)** is a **per-org configurable £**, not a fixed amount. Applied per standard order, floored at zero.
- **Roles skipped this phase** — no `memberships.role` widening, no role selector. The two screens are reachable from the **Finance** menu (My commission) and admin area (Commission rules); role-based home routing is deferred (§14.5 migration still pending for that).

### 7.2 The kinds of rule an org can configure (no figures — every value is entered by the org)
> ⚠️ No rate, amount or threshold is shown here or stored in code. The list below is only the **types** of rule the Commission rules area supports; each organisation enters its own values (all blank/zero until they do).
- **One-off sales:** a rate the org sets, applied to **profit** (= invoiced value − direct third-party delivery costs − the org's configured internal cost per sale).
- **Recurring contracts:** a rate the org sets, applied to recurring monthly profit while employed and the customer remains active.
- **Referral:** a rate the org sets, applied to commission revenue from a referred opportunity — paid-gated.
- **Finance agreements:** a rate the org sets, applied to financed value.
- **Performance bonus:** when personally-generated turnover exceeds the org's configured threshold within the period → the org's configured bonus rate applied to total profit generated that period.
- Payable only after invoices fully settled; ceases on termination; refunds/cancellations offset future commission; employer determines calculations in good faith; commission only where the employee was the effective cause.

### 7.3 Engine rules (apply to whatever ruleset an org configures)
- **All figures ex-VAT.**
- **Paid-gated:** nothing becomes payable until the order's invoice is flagged **Paid**.
- **Manager-approved:** the engine **calculates a suggestion**; a manager approves each period before payroll (per-period lock).
- **Period boundary is configurable** (`periodStartDay`, 1–28). The period boundary is whatever day-of-month the org enters into config — not a constant.
- **Manual £ override per order** (`commission_overrides`) always wins over the computed suggestion.
- **Offsets / termination:** offsets for refunds/cancellations and termination handling are future enhancements; not in the v1 engine.
- **Admin "Commission rules" area:** the org sets `oneOffRate`, `deductionPerSale`, `financeRate`, `referralRate`, `recurringRate`, `thresholdTurnover`, `bonusRate`, `periodStartDay`, and the `enabled` switch. All blank/zero by default.

### 7.4 Bonus screen (sales)  (mockup: `user_commission_bonus_screen`)
Per-user. Always shows the live 25th–25th period:
- Metric cards: **Confirmed (payable — invoices paid)**, **Pending (awaiting settlement)**, **Performance bonus** status (locked/unlocked).
- **Threshold progress bar:** personally-generated turnover toward the org's configured threshold (unlocks the performance bonus).
- **Breakdown** by source (one-off / recurring / finance / referral) with basis, rate, amount, and a paid/pending status pill.
- **Running monthly totals** for previous periods (paid).
- Footnote: calculated automatically, manager-approved before payroll, offsets noted.

## 8. Engineer wage-progression scheme (DECIDED · BUILT in Phase 4 — see §14.7)

Engineers get a **different home screen** from sales. They do **not** see per-company deal profit or commission.

**Rules (locked):**
- **Per-engineer** (not team-wide).
- Wage rises in **rolling 6-month stages**, triggered by a **count of delivered/new deals** in the stage — a neutral metric that exposes no profit.
- The **£ rise is a manual field a manager sets/confirms** per stage (consistent with the "manual £ field on every bonus" rule). The engine doesn't auto-pay a rise; a manager enters and confirms it.
- The engineer sees: current rate, deals delivered this stage, a progress bar to the next review point, the projected/confirmed rise, and a **history** of previous stages and the rise applied. Company profit/commission never appear.
- Mockup: `engineer_wage_progression` (in the Phase-2 mockups file).

**OPEN QUESTION — RESOLVED:** deal-count-triggered, manager-set £ rise, per-engineer, neutral count shown (no profit). See rules above.

---

## 9. Accounting integration (Xero / QuickBooks) — LATER

Decision: **neither now**, possibly later. WorkTrackr will **not** be the accounts package. For now, **Invoiced** and **Paid** are manual flags a manager ticks on the order. Later: a connector that pushes the order as an invoice and pulls back paid status automatically (commission gating then becomes automatic).

---

## 10. Build order (phased, one at a time)

1. ✅ **DONE — Menu / IA regroup** + company-centred records with sales stage & account manager.
2. ✅ **DONE — Contacts, history timeline, tasks** (+ tasks dashboard).
3. ✅ **DONE — Orders module** — blank order form (+ supplier/cost/profit columns, IDYQ quote pull), approval queue, purchasing queue, fulfilment (invoiced/paid) flags.
4. ✅ **DONE — Commission engine** — fully-configurable rules area (per-org, nothing hardcoded) + live calculator (ex-VAT, paid-gated, manager-approved) + **sales bonus screen** + **engineer wage-progression screen**.
5. ✅ **DONE — IDYQ "act on quote" actions + Contracts** (mark won → Contract; recurring profit tracking; recurring commission home).
6. ◑ **DONE then SUPERSEDED — Deals + CSV import** (§16): the slim Deals list was built, but the Deals concept was reframed as **Leads** in Phase 7 (the CSV import remains, now on the Companies tab).
7. ✅ **DONE — Leads** (Phase 7, §14.14): reframe "Deals" as a company-centred chase list (stage *Suspect*→*New*); Leads screen + Add-lead form + guided Convert-to-customer + delete→archive (manager Archived view) + slide-over Notes panel with email drag-in.
8. ✅ **DONE — Sidebar consolidation** (Phase 8, §14.15–§14.18): single tabbed **Sales** entry (Companies/Leads/Quotes/Orders/Contracts); **Approvals**→Workspace; the two calendars merged into one **blended Calendar**.
9. **(Later)** Widen `memberships.role` for role-based home routing; Xero/QuickBooks connector; IDYQ org allow-list before any 3rd-party onboarding; store original email files for the Notes panel.

UX is designed before coding each phase.

---

## 11. Open questions / follow-ups
- Engineer wage-rise **formula** — **RESOLVED** (§8): deal-count, manager-set £, per-engineer.
- Order "New order" start: **blank** confirmed. (Recurring still pulls from IDYQ when relevant.)
- Approval chain: **RESOLVED — single manager approver for v1.** Approvals stored in their own per-order table so a chain can be added later without rework.
- Quote→order **cost/profit/type pull**: **BUILT on both apps** (see §14.1), ready to deploy; consumed at Phase 3.
- IDYQ **org allow-list** on the bridge before onboarding third-party customers (security). Still open.
- Optional: make the **Quotes** tab live read-through too (merging WorkTrackr-side link data) — offered, not yet requested.
- Secret rotation for previously-committed live secrets in `RENDER_SETUP.md` was advised; user chose to defer. (Scrubbed file + hardened `.gitignore` were prepared but not deployed.)

---

## 12. Decisions log
- Integration is **read-only**, server-to-server, mirror tables, per-org opt-in. ✅
- Per-org scoping via `X-WT-Org` header + stored `idyq_org_ref` (replaced an earlier email-env approach). ✅
- Catalogue **display is live read-through** (always current incl. deletes); mirror is fallback. ✅
- Catalogue **grouped by category, collapsible**; categories already flow in the feed (no extra work needed). ✅
- "Editable IDYQ" = **profit fields across + act-on-quote**, not editing quote content. ✅
- Xero/QuickBooks: **later**. ✅
- New **roles** added in the Users section. ✅
- Bonuses **automatic**, per-user bonus screen, **25th–25th** period, running totals; manager-approved, paid-gated, ex-VAT. ✅
- Commission rules must be **configurable** (multi-sector). ✅
- Order form **always starts blank**; no pre-import of existing deals/customers. ✅
- **Engineers see a separate wage-progression screen**, never per-company profit. ✅
- UX mockups approved: pipeline list, company profile, bonus screen, sales flow, order form, approval/purchasing queues, engineer wage progression. ✅
- **Roles = Global Admin / Manager / Salesman / Engineer**, toggled per member in Users (replaces the earlier account-manager/purchasing/read-only set). ✅
- **Single manager approver** for order approval (v1); chain deferrable. ✅
- **Engineer wage**: per-engineer, deal-count-triggered, manager-set £ rise, neutral count shown, no profit. ✅
- **Every bonus/wage figure has a manual £ field** a manager sets; engine only suggests. ✅
- Orders can **pull IDYQ quotes**, bringing buy-in cost/profit/type per line, read-only (edited in IDYQ). Distinct from recurring Contracts. ✅
- Quote→order pull **built on both apps** (bridge + WorkTrackr migration/sync/mapper), deploy-ready. ✅
- Phase 1 started: contacts `crm.salesStage` (Suspect/Prospect/Hot Prospect/Customer) + company/stage filters. ✅
- Phase 1 complete: IA regroup (Sales/Delivery/Finance/Contacts/Settings), company pipeline list + company profile hub. ✅
- Phase 2 complete: `tasks` table + API, My-Tasks dashboard, editable company contacts, per-company tasks, history timeline (CRM events + completed tasks). ✅
- Phase 3 complete: Orders module — `orders`/`order_lines`/`order_approvals` tables + API, order form (manual lines + IDYQ pull, cost+profit economics), orders list, "New order" from company profile, manager Approval/Purchasing/Fulfilment queues, full Draft→Submitted→Approved→Ordered→Invoiced→Paid lifecycle (paid-gating ready for commission). ✅
- **NO HARDCODED MONEY RULES (non-negotiable, §1):** no commission/bonus/share/deduction/threshold/period figure is ever in code. All per-org config in `commission_settings`; app ships neutral (zeros/disabled). Any specific schedule is example-only. ✅
- Phase 4 scope: recurring **deferred to Phase 5** (needs Contracts); finance/referral via per-order **commission_category** + configured rates; internal cost-before-profit is a **per-org configurable £** (not a fixed amount); **roles skipped** this phase (screens reachable from Finance menu; no role-constraint widening). ✅
- Phase 4 engine: configurable `periodStartDay` (default 1; the start day is config, not code), manual £ override per order wins over suggestion, manager per-period lock, computed live from paid orders. ✅
- Phase 4 COMPLETE: commission backend + admin **Commission rules** + **My commission** bonus screen + per-order commission category; engineer wage backend + **My wage** (engineer, read-only, no profit) + **Engineer wages** (manager) + per-org scheme settings. All per-org configurable; zero hardcoded money. ✅
- Phase 5 decisions LOCKED: recurring commission **automatic while a contract is active** (no per-month toggle; gate = active + existing per-period manager approval); basis = **clear monthly profit**, annual ÷ 12; **mid-period start = full month**; recurring charge **counts toward the bonus threshold**; **mixed quotes auto-sort by line type** (monthly/annual → contract, one-off/untagged → auto-created linked Order, one screen); **new Contracts page** in Sales + "New contract" on the company; company **Monthly profit auto-calculated** from active contracts. ✅
- Phase 5 BATCH 1 built: `contracts`/`contract_lines`/`contract_commission_overrides` tables + `contracts.js` (incl. auto-sorting `pull-quote`) + `idyq.js` `mapLine` fix + `/api/contracts` mount. ✅
- Phase 5 BATCH 2 built: recurring commission wired into `commission.js` (active contracts → Confirmed + breakdown + threshold + bonus base + history; per-contract per-period manual £; rate read only from the org's `recurringRate`, 0 by default), `BonusScreen.jsx` + `CommissionRules.jsx` updated (recurring field enabled). **All example commission figures removed from the docs and mockups** per the no-example-numbers rule — §7.2 now lists rule types only. ✅
- Phase 5 BATCH 3 built: `ContractsList.jsx` + `ContractForm.jsx` (auto-sorting quote pull, monthly/annual lines, status actions) + nav (Sidebar Contracts in Sales, Dashboard view, AppLayout map) + "New contract" on the company profile. Manager-only pause/cancel via `isManager`. ✅
- IA consolidation (v1.2) — confirmed by user: section order **Workspace → Delivery → Sales → Finance → Settings**; **keep two calendars** (CRM Calendar → Sales, tickets Calendar → Delivery; verified distinct in code); **one shared customer hub** (Companies, shared by Sales + Delivery via `tickets.contact_id`).
- Phase 5 BATCH 4 built: company profile **Services & monthly profit** panel + **Monthly profit** / **Active services** cards now auto-fill from the company's active contracts (`CompanyProfile.jsx`); manual `crm.totalProfit` kept only as a fallback. ✅
- Phase 5 BATCH 5 built + **PHASE 5 COMPLETE**: act-on-quote buttons on the IDYQ quote view (`IdyqIntegration.jsx`) — Create contract / Create order from a quote — plus a new `orders` pull-quote endpoint (`orders.js`). ✅ sidebar regrouped (Workspace/Delivery/Sales/Finance/Settings), **My Pay** merges My wage + My commission, pay-admin (Commission rules, Engineer wages) + Catalogue + CRM settings moved into Settings (manager tier + admin tier), CRM Calendar moved to Sales, Contacts + Company Notes top-level items removed. **CRM page left fully intact** to protect native (non-IDYQ) Quotes/Catalogue/Quote-Templates — consolidation done at sidebar level only. Every menu item verified to resolve to a screen. See §14.11. ✅
- Phase 6 SLIMMED at user request (v1.7): dropped probability/weighting/win-rate/quarter-forecast/auto-convert/linked-quote. Kept a simple deals list (Open/In progress/Won/Lost) with an "open pipeline" total, + a simple CSV company import. **Deals half BUILT** (`deals` table + `deals.js` + DealsList/DealForm + nav); CSV import next. ✅
- Phase 6 (slim) COMPLETE (v1.8): CSV company import built — `POST /api/contacts/import` + `CsvImport.jsx` wizard + Import button on the Companies page (dedupe by name/email). Both halves done. ✅
- **Phase 7 / v2.0 — "Deals" reframed as "Leads":** a lead **is a company** at a non-customer stage (no money on a lead; money appears later at quote/order/contract). Sales stage **Suspect renamed New** (value `new`) everywhere; ladder New → Prospect → Hot prospect → Customer. Leads list is the chase view (company/contact/phone/email/stage/owner/first-contact/next-action/chase-date, UK dates, overdue red, sortable, stage chips, search, Mine-only). ✅
- **Convert to customer is a guided modal** (confirm contacts + account manager + optional address) that **promotes the same company record** (`crm.salesStage='customer'`, `status='active'`) — keeps notes/history, no duplicate. ✅
- **Delete = archive, never erase:** sets `crm.archived=true`; archived leads hidden from everyone; **managers** get an Archived view to Restore or permanently Delete. `GET /api/contacts` excludes archived by default; `?archived=only` is manager-gated. ✅
- **Lead Notes = own store, shown on the profile timeline, never on the calendar:** new `contact_notes` table (kind `note`/`email`); surfaced via `GET /:id/history`; **not** written to `crm_events` (so notes don't pollute the Calendar). Email drag-in logs subject + text only — the original file is **not** stored. ✅
- **Phase 8 / v2.0 — sidebar consolidation (Option A, approved):** the seven Sales items collapse into a single **Sales** entry with five tabs (Companies/Leads/Quotes/Orders/Contracts, via `SalesTabs.jsx`); `AppLayout` maps all five views to the one `sales` item so it stays highlighted. **Approvals moved to Workspace** (manager-only). ✅
- **One blended Calendar (Option B, approved):** the separate "CRM Calendar" item is gone; the single **Calendar** is the CRM month grid extended to also show **scheduled tickets** (from app context) and **work calendar events** (`/api/calendar/events`) as read-only, colour-coded items, with **Sales / Projects / Schedule** toggles. Clicking a ticket opens it; CRM events stay fully editable. Known tradeoff: creating brand-new *standalone* work-calendar entries isn't on this screen (existing ones still show); re-add if used. ✅

---

## 13. Mockups produced

**Saved in the repo:** `docs/mockups/ux-design-mockups.html` is now the **single canonical file** holding all nine approved screens (1 sales-pipeline flow, 2 company pipeline list, 3 company profile, 4 sales commission &amp; bonus, 5 order form, 6 approval &amp; purchasing queues, 7 engineer wage progression, 8 My Tasks dashboard, 9 enriched company profile). It is self-contained and browser-openable with a CSS shim; a fresh Claude chat can re-render any screen. (The earlier split files `ux-design-mockups-phase2.html` and `ux-design-mockups-phase2-tasks-history.html` are now superseded by the canonical file.)

- **`worktrackr_sales_pipeline_flow`** — the §3 flow diagram (two branches → shared finance pipeline).
- **`crm_company_pipeline_list`** — §5.2.
- **`crm_company_profile`** — §5.3.
- **`user_commission_bonus_screen`** — §7.4.
- **`order_form`** — §5.5 (incl. IDYQ quote pull, read-only cost/profit).
- **`approval_purchasing_queues`** — §5.6 (single approver).
- **`engineer_wage_progression`** — §8 (per-engineer, manual rise field).

---

## 14. Key file map (Phase 0, for maintenance)
- IDYQ: `server/_core/worktrackrBridge.ts`, `server/_core/index.ts`.
- WorkTrackr backend: `web/routes/idyq.js`, `shared/idyq/{idyqClient,idyqSync,index}.js`, `worker/worker.js`, `web/server.js`, migrations `web/migrations/create_idyq_integration_tables.sql`, `idyq_add_org_ref.sql`, `idyq_catalogue_fields.sql`.
- WorkTrackr frontend: `web/client/src/app/src/components/IdyqIntegration.jsx`, `CRMDashboard.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`.
- Test (run from WorkTrackr web shell): `node -e 'require("./shared/idyq/idyqClient").idyqGet("/api/external/catalogue",{page:1},{orgRef:"sweetbyte-ltd-mo5yzrt7"}).then(r=>console.log(r.products?.length))'`

### 14.1 Quote→order cost/profit/type pull (BUILT, deploy-ready; used at Phase 3)
Verified gap: the bridge previously emitted quote lines sell-only (`product_id, sku, description, qty, unit_price, line_total`) — IDYQ's per-line **buy-in cost** (`quote_line_items.cost_price`) and **type** (`pricing_type`, e.g. `one_off`/`annual`) never crossed; profit is derived in IDYQ's UI (`total − cost×qty`), not stored.
- **IDYQ** `server/_core/worktrackrBridge.ts` — `mapLine` now also emits `cost_price`, `profit` (computed `total − cost×qty`, to match the quote to the penny), `pricing_type`.
- **WorkTrackr** `web/migrations/idyq_quote_line_cost_fields.sql` (NEW) — adds `cost_price`, `line_profit`, `line_type` to `idyq_quote_lines` (idempotent; sorts after `create_idyq_integration_tables.sql`).
- **WorkTrackr** `shared/idyq/idyqSync.js` — quote-line insert stores the three new fields.
- **WorkTrackr** `web/routes/idyq.js` — `mapLine` exposes `buyInCost`, `profit`, `type`.
- Deploy order: IDYQ first, then WorkTrackr. Verify: re-run the quote-203 line fetch; the line should carry `cost_price`/`profit`/`pricing_type`. All additive/read-only; no behaviour change until the order form consumes it.

### 14.2 Phase 1 progress
- `web/routes/contacts.js` — `crm.salesStage` enum (suspect/prospect/hot_prospect/customer) added (separate from `crm.status`); account manager = `crm.assignedTo`; list endpoint takes `?type=` and `?stage=` filters. No migration (rides the `crm` JSONB).

### 14.3 Phase 2 file map (BUILT)
- `web/migrations/create_tasks_table.sql` (NEW) — `tasks` (title, status open/done + `completed_at`, priority, due_date, `contact_id`, assignee/creator, org-scoped).
- `web/routes/tasks.js` (NEW) — CRUD + filters `?mine`, `?status`, `?contactId`; setting status `done` stamps `completed_at`.
- `web/routes/contacts.js` — added `GET /:id/history` (aggregates `crm_events` + completed `tasks`, newest first; two-segment path, no clash with `/:id`).
- `web/server.js` — mounts `/api/tasks`.
- Frontend (`web/client/src/app/src/components/`): `MyTasks.jsx` (NEW dashboard, top of Sales), `CompanyProfile.jsx` (enriched: editable `contactPersons` with decision-maker flag, per-company tasks, history timeline), plus `Sidebar.jsx`/`AppLayout.jsx`/`Dashboard.jsx` nav for **My Tasks** (`my-tasks`).

### 14.4 Phase 3 file map (BUILT) — Orders module
- `web/migrations/create_orders_tables.sql` (NEW) — `orders` (status enum draft→submitted→approved/rejected→ordered→invoiced→paid, `invoiced_at`/`paid_at`, `contact_id`, `salesperson_user_id`), `order_lines` (description, qty, supplier_url, `unit_cost`, `unit_profit`, source manual|idyq, `idyq_quote_id`, `line_type`), `order_approvals` (single approver now, chain-ready).
- `web/routes/orders.js` (NEW) — list (`?status`/`?contactId`/`?mine`/`?queue=approval|purchasing`), get, create, PUT (header + replace lines, draft/rejected only), `/submit`, `/approve`, `/reject`, `/purchase`, `/invoice`, `/pay` (manager-gated via `getOrgContext().role`), `/pull-quote` (appends mirrored IDYQ quote lines with cost/profit/type), delete (draft only).
- `web/server.js` — mounts `/api/orders`.
- Frontend (`web/client/src/app/src/components/`): `OrderForm.jsx` (NEW; company picker, status stepper, manual+IDYQ lines, cost/profit totals, save draft/submit), `OrdersList.jsx` (NEW; list + status filters, hosts the form), `OrderQueues.jsx` (NEW; manager Approval/Purchasing/Fulfilment queues). Wiring in `Dashboard.jsx` (`orders` + `order-queues` views, New-order hop from profile), `Sidebar.jsx` (Orders item; **Approvals** item shown only when `isManager`), `AppLayout.jsx` + `DashboardWithLayout.jsx` (thread `isManager`).
- Economics: a line's sell = `unit_cost + unit_profit`; IDYQ lines are read-only (edited on the quote in IDYQ). `total_profit` on a **paid** order is the figure Phase 4 commission will read.
- Dependency: the order form's IDYQ pull shows real cost/profit only once §14.1's four "pull" files are deployed and a sync has run; the manual path works regardless.

### 14.5 memberships.role CHECK — ✅ WIDENED in v2.4 (was outstanding through v2.3)
`database/schema.sql` still has `CHECK (role IN ('admin','manager','staff'))`. The new **Salesman** and **Engineer** roles need an `ALTER ... DROP CONSTRAINT / ADD CONSTRAINT` migration widening this to include `'salesman'` and `'engineer'` **before** the roles toggle UI is built. Manager-gating in Phase 3 keys off `admin`/`manager`/`partner_admin`, so it works today; Salesman/Engineer home screens (Phase 4) need the constraint widened first.

### 14.6 Phase 4 file map — commission engine (BUILT)
**Principle enforced: zero hardcoded money values (see §1, §7.1).** App ships neutral; each org configures its own scheme.
- `web/migrations/phase4_commission_tables.sql` (NEW) — `commission_settings` (per-org `config` JSONB, neutral defaults), `commission_overrides` (manual £ per order, the per-order override field), `commission_period_locks` (manager per-period approval); `ALTER orders ADD commission_category`. Filename `phase4_` sorts after `create_orders_tables.sql`.
- `web/routes/commission.js` (NEW) — inline engine + API. `DEFAULTS` are all 0/false (no scheme baked in). Config shape: `enabled, oneOffRate, deductionPerSale, financeRate, referralRate, recurringRate, thresholdTurnover, bonusRate, periodStartDay`. Endpoints: `GET/PUT /settings` (PUT manager-only), `GET /me?offset=` (bonus screen: confirmed/pending/bonus/threshold/breakdown/history, paid-gated), `GET /period?offset=` + `POST /period/approve` (manager), `PUT /override/:orderId` (manager). Period math = `periodStartDay`-based 1-month windows, year-cross safe; verified (25th→25th, Dec→Jan).
- `web/server.js` — mounts `/api/commission`.
- **Front-end (BUILT):** `CommissionRules.jsx` (admin: org enters its own numbers; blank by default; manager-gated), `BonusScreen.jsx` (per-user "My commission", reads `/me`: confirmed/pending/bonus/threshold/breakdown/history), commission-category selector on `OrderForm.jsx` (orders API persists `commission_category`), nav wired in `Sidebar.jsx`/`AppLayout.jsx`/`Dashboard.jsx` (My commission in Finance for all; Commission rules manager-only). Engineer wage front-end is in §14.7.

### 14.7 Phase 4 file map — engineer wage progression (BUILT)
**Same no-hardcode rule (§1).** Org sets stage length + deal-count target; every £ is a manager-entered field; engineers never see profit.
- `web/migrations/phase4_engineer_wage_tables.sql` (NEW) — `engineer_wage_settings` (per-org `config` JSONB: `stageMonths`, `dealCountTarget`; neutral defaults) and `engineer_wage_records` (per engineer per stage: `current_rate`, `deals_delivered` (neutral count), `deal_target`, `rise_amount`, `new_rate` — all manual £/int; `status` in_progress|confirmed; stage history). Filename `phase4_` sorts after `create_orders_tables.sql`.
- `web/routes/engineerWage.js` (NEW) — `GET/PUT /settings` (PUT manager), `GET /candidates` (manager; org members for the picker), `GET /me` (engineer's current stage + history, read-only), `GET /` (manager; all engineers), `POST /` (start a stage), `PUT /:id` (manual fields), `POST /:id/confirm`, `DELETE /:id`. Manager-gated via role.
- `web/server.js` — mounts `/api/engineer-wage`.
- Frontend (`web/client/src/app/src/components/`): `EngineerWage.jsx` (NEW; "My wage", engineer read-only — current rate, neutral deal count vs target, review date, manager-set rise, history; never profit), `EngineerWageAdmin.jsx` (NEW; manager — scheme settings, start a stage, enter count, set/confirm £ rise). Nav: **My wage** in Delivery (all users), **Engineer wages** manager-only in Delivery; views wired in `Dashboard.jsx`, `AppLayout.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`.

### 14.8 Phase 5 file map — BATCH 1 (contracts backend foundation, BUILT)
**Same no-hardcode rule (§1): no money figure in code; contract figures come from the pulled quote (read-only) or manual in-app entry.**
- `web/migrations/phase5_contracts_tables.sql` (NEW) — `contracts` (status draft/active/paused/cancelled, `source_idyq_quote_id`, `started_at`/`cancelled_at`, `salesperson_user_id`), `contract_lines` (recurring only; `unit_cost`/`unit_profit` at the line's own `billing_interval` monthly|annual, `source` manual|idyq), `contract_commission_overrides` (manager manual £ per contract per period — used by batch 2). Filename `phase5_` sorts after orders + idyq migrations. Validated against the real Postgres grammar.
- `web/routes/contracts.js` (NEW) — list (`?status`/`?contactId`/`?mine`), get, create, PUT (header + replace lines, not while cancelled), **`/:id/pull-quote`** (auto-sorts a mirrored quote: monthly/annual lines → this contract; one-off/untagged → a linked draft Order created automatically — one action), `/:id/activate` (draft|paused→active, stamps `started_at` once), `/:id/pause` (manager), `/:id/cancel` (manager), delete (draft only). Per-month figures normalise annual ÷ 12 in SQL. Manager-gating = admin/manager/owner/partner_admin.
- `web/routes/idyq.js` (EDITED) — `mapLine` now exposes `buyInCost`/`profit`/`type` from the mirror, so the order form's IDYQ pull shows real cost/profit + type and the contract pull can sort by type. (Small additive fix flagged in design; the order-form pull previously came across cost £0/no type.)
- `web/server.js` (EDITED) — mounts `/api/contracts` (after `/api/orders`).
- Dependency: the type-based sort needs the IDYQ-side `pricing_type`/`line_type` tag live + a sync (verify `worktrackrBridge.ts` in `idoyourquotes-main`). Untagged lines default to one-off (safe — never invents recurring profit).

### 14.9 Phase 5 file map — BATCH 2 (recurring commission wiring, BUILT)
**Reads only the org-entered recurring rate; no figure in code (rate defaults to 0).**
- `web/routes/commission.js` (EDITED — full rewrite preserving the one-off engine) — adds recurring: `userContracts` (per-month profit/charge, annual ÷ 12 in SQL), `contractOverrides`, `contractEarnsInPeriod` (active + start/cancel dates; draft/paused don't earn), `contractAmount` (monthly profit × the org's `recurringRate`, or a manager manual £), `contractRow` (breakdown row, `category:'recurring'`). `computeForUser` now folds active contracts into Confirmed, the breakdown, the bonus threshold turnover **and** the bonus profit base (Decision 5), and into the 3-period history. `/period` now lists salespeople from orders **or** contracts. New endpoint `PUT /contract-override/:contractId {amount,note,offset}` (manager) — manual £ per contract per period. Every breakdown row now carries a unique `key`.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/BonusScreen.jsx` (EDITED) — keys breakdown rows by the new `key` (recurring rows have no order id), header "Order" → "Source", footnote mentions active contracts. Recurring rows render via the pre-existing `recurring` category.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/CommissionRules.jsx` (EDITED) — the **Recurring rate** field is now enabled (was disabled pending Phase 5); help text is neutral; the example day-of-month was removed from the period-start help. (No example values anywhere; fields load from saved config, zero by default.)
- **Docs scrub (this batch):** every example commission figure removed from the roadmap (§1, §5.5, §7.1, §7.2, §7.3, §7.4, build order, decisions log) and from `docs/mockups/ux-design-mockups-phase5.html` (rates/amounts/threshold shown as "—", read from config). §7.2 now lists rule *types* only, no numbers.

### 14.10 Phase 5 file map — BATCH 3 (Contracts UI + nav, BUILT)
**No money figure in any field; all values come from the quote (read-only) or are typed in.**
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/ContractsList.jsx` (NEW) — recurring contracts list (teal accent), filters all/draft/active/paused/cancelled, columns Company / Salesperson / Charge·mo / Profit·mo, "active recurring profit £/mo" summary, hosts the form. Mirrors `OrdersList.jsx`.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/ContractForm.jsx` (NEW) — create/edit a draft, **Pull from IdoYourQuotes** (calls the backend `pull-quote`; saves a draft first if new, then shows "N one-off items started as a separate order"), recurring line table with a monthly/annual interval picker and a per-line **Profit / mo** column (annual ÷ 12), monthly totals, status pill + actions Save / Activate·Resume (all) / Pause·Cancel (manager only, via `isManager` prop; backend also enforces). IDYQ lines read-only.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` (EDITED) — **Contracts** item in Sales under Orders (Repeat icon).
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/AppLayout.jsx` (EDITED) — `contracts → 'contracts'` in VIEW_TO_PAGE.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (EDITED) — imports + renders `<ContractsList>`; derives `isManager` from membership role; `contractsInitial` state; passes `onNewContract` to the company profile.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/CompanyProfile.jsx` (EDITED) — **New contract** button beside New order (Repeat icon), `onNewContract` prop.

### 14.11 IA consolidation file map (BUILT, v1.3)
**Sidebar-level only; the CRM page and all native (non-IDYQ) functionality untouched.**
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` (EDITED) — sections regrouped to **Workspace → Delivery → Sales → Finance → Settings**. Workspace (My Tasks, **My Pay**, My Notes); Delivery (Tickets, Projects, Calendar); Sales (Companies, Quotes, Orders, Contracts, CRM Calendar, + Approvals when manager); Finance (Invoices); Settings shown to managers/admins — manager tier (Commission rules, Engineer wages, CRM settings) then admin tier (Catalogue, Pricing, Users, Billing, Security, Email Intake). Standalone Contacts + Company Notes items dropped.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/MyPay.jsx` (NEW) — Workspace "My Pay"; one page with a Commission/Wage toggle, reusing `BonusScreen` + `EngineerWage` unchanged.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/AppLayout.jsx` (EDITED) — `my-pay` and `crm-settings` added to VIEW_TO_PAGE.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (EDITED) — imports + renders `<MyPay>` (`my-pay`) and the CRM page at its settings tab (`crm-settings`). Legacy `my-commission`/`my-wage` renders left in place (unreachable from nav, harmless).
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/CRMDashboard.jsx` (EDITED) — inert `singleSection` prop (off by default; header/stat-strip/tab-bar wrap so it *can* be hidden later, but isn't now). **No functional change** — IDYQ and native Quotes/Catalogue/Quote-Templates all behave as before.
- Verified: every sidebar item resolves to a Dashboard render and highlights via VIEW_TO_PAGE; no dead links.
- Not done (deliberate): the CRM "Customers" tab and the ticket→company click-through are left for a later careful pass once Companies-hub parity is confirmed.

### 14.12 Phase 5 file map — BATCH 4 (company profile services panel + cards, BUILT)
**Reads only the contract API; no money figure in code.**
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/CompanyProfile.jsx` (EDITED) — loads the company's **active** contracts (`/api/contracts?contactId=&status=active`) and their lines, aggregates them into the **Services & monthly profit** panel (per-service charge / cost / profit, monthly-normalised — annual shown as `/yr ÷12`; "IDYQ" badge on pulled lines; teal total-recurring-per-month row; read-only note). The **Monthly profit** card is now auto-calculated from those active contracts (Decision 7), falling back to the manual `crm.totalProfit` only when there are no active contracts; the **Active services** card shows the active service-line count. Empty + loading states handled.

### 14.13 Phase 5 file map — BATCH 5 (act-on-quote, BUILT — Phase 5 COMPLETE)
- `web/routes/orders.js` (EDITED) — new `POST /:id/pull-quote` (mirrors the contracts pull: adds all of a mirrored quote's lines with cost/profit/type from the mirror, fills the order's company from the quote's linked contact if unset). Draft-only.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/IdyqIntegration.jsx` (EDITED) — `QuoteRow` (the expandable IDYQ quote) gains an **"Act on this quote"** bar: **Create contract** (POST `/api/contracts` → pull-quote; auto-sorts, spins one-off lines into an order) and **Create order** (POST `/api/orders` → pull-quote; snapshots the whole quote). Inline success/error feedback. Secondary "act on quote" entry (§2.11); primary entries remain the Contracts/Orders pages + the company profile.
- Note: these buttons live in the IDYQ quotes view, shown only when IdoYourQuotes is connected; non-IDYQ orgs use the native flows.

---

### 14.14 Phase 7 file map — Leads (BUILT; replaces Deals)
- `web/migrations/phase7_leads_stage_rename.sql` (NEW) — one-off `UPDATE` migrating any `crm.salesStage='suspect'` → `'new'`.
- `web/routes/contacts.js` (EDITED) — crm Zod `salesStage` enum `suspect`→`new`; new crm fields `firstContact`, `chaseDate`, `nextAction`, `archived`, `archivedAt`; CSV import stage list updated (legacy `suspect` still accepted as an alias); `GET /` excludes archived by default, `?archived=only` is manager-gated.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/LeadsList.jsx` (NEW) — the chase list: columns, sortable headers, stage chips + counts, search, Mine-only, Import (reuses `CsvImport`), Add-lead; per-row **Notes / Convert / Delete(archive)**; manager **Archived** view (Restore / permanent Delete) via an `isManager` prop.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/AddLeadModal.jsx` (NEW) — quick "add a company as a lead" form.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/ConvertToCustomerModal.jsx` (NEW) — guided convert (confirm contacts + account manager + optional address → promote same record to customer).
- `CompanyPipelineList.jsx`, `CompanyProfile.jsx` (EDITED) — STAGES `suspect`→`new` label/key.

### 14.15 Phase 8 file map — tabbed Sales + Approvals move (BUILT)
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/SalesTabs.jsx` (NEW) — the Companies/Leads/Quotes/Orders/Contracts tab bar.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` (EDITED) — Sales collapsed to a single `{ view:'companies' }` entry; **Approvals** moved into Workspace (manager-only).
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/AppLayout.jsx` (EDITED) — `companies/leads/quotes/orders/contracts` all map to the one `sales` item (stays highlighted across tabs).
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (EDITED) — renders `SalesTabs` above the sales views (hidden when a company profile is open); `Dashboard` is a `forwardRef`.

### 14.16 Phase 8 file map — one blended Calendar (BUILT)
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/CRMCalendar.jsx` (EDITED — now the single Calendar) — added event types `ticket`/`schedule`; pulls `tickets` from `useSimulation()` and `/api/calendar/events`; a `scheduleItems` memo; **Sales / Projects / Schedule** toggle pills; `getEventsForDate` gated by toggles; a shared `openEvent()` (tickets → `onTicketClick`, schedule entries read-only, CRM events → edit modal); title "CRM Calendar"→"Calendar".
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` (EDITED) — the separate "CRM Calendar" item removed; one **Calendar** in Delivery.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (EDITED) — the `calendar` view now renders the blended `CRMCalendar` (was `IntegratedCalendar`, now unused import).

### 14.17 Phase 8 file map — lead Notes panel (BUILT)
- `web/migrations/phase8_contact_notes.sql` (NEW) — `contact_notes` table (`kind` `note`/`email`, subject, body, created_by, created_at) + indexes.
- `web/routes/contacts.js` (EDITED) — `GET /:id/history` also aggregates `contact_notes` (wrapped in try/catch for pre-migration safety); new `POST /:id/notes`.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/LeadNotesPanel.jsx` (NEW) — slide-over: timeline (kind→icon, UK dates), add-note box, email drop zone (reads `.eml`/`.txt` text + `Subject:` header, else filename as subject; logs subject + text, no file storage).
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/LeadsList.jsx` (EDITED) — per-row **Notes** icon opens the panel.

### 14.19 Phase 8.1 file map — Sales UX consolidation (v2.1, BUILT)
**Goal: every Sales tab shares one look (the Leads tab) so they can't drift; declutter the Quotes/CRM-settings/Catalogue surfaces. Pure front-end; no SQL; no money figures.**
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/SalesPageLayout.jsx` (NEW) — the single shared chrome for every Sales tab: page wrapper + width, header (title + count subtitle + right-aligned actions), rounded-full filter-pill row, bordered/rounded table shell. Exports building blocks `SalesSearch`, `SalesPrimaryButton` (green `#1D9E75`), `SalesSecondaryButton` (grey; green-toggle when `active`), `SalesAllPill`, `SalesFilterPill` (semantic colour via `pillClass`, amber active-ring, opt-in `capitalize`). `maxWidth` prop (default `max-w-5xl`; Leads passes `max-w-7xl`).
- `CompanyPipelineList.jsx`, `OrdersList.jsx`, `ContractsList.jsx`, `LeadsList.jsx` (EDITED) — re-skinned onto `SalesPageLayout` (green primary button, rounded-full pills with counts, search on every page). All data logic unchanged (verified by diff against the prior versions); Orders/Contracts gained a search box; Contracts keeps its repeat icon, recurring-profit subtitle and footnote.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/SalesQuotes.jsx` (NEW) — the Quotes tab. `useIdyqConnection()`: **connected →** the read-only IDYQ quotes list (reuses `IdyqQuotesView`, which keeps line-item expand + the act-on-quote actions); **not connected →** the org's native `/api/quotes` in the shared chrome with a "Create quote" button. No stat cards, no inner sub-tabs (the duplicate "Customers" sub-tab is gone from here; Catalog/CRM-settings live under Settings).
- `Dashboard.jsx` (EDITED) — `quotes` view now renders `<SalesQuotes/>` (was `CRMDashboard defaultTab="quotes"`); `crm-settings` and `product-catalog` views now pass `singleSection` to `CRMDashboard` (strips the "Customer Relationship Management" title + 4 stat cards + inner sub-tab bar — only the relevant content shows); added the `sales-calendar` view (renders `CRMCalendar` with `defaultSources={{sales:true,projects:false,schedule:false}}` + ticket click-through) and added `sales-calendar` to `SALES_VIEWS`.
- `SalesTabs.jsx` (EDITED) — sixth tab **Calendar** (`view:'sales-calendar'`); tab-bar width aligned to the list pages (`max-w-5xl`).
- `CRMCalendar.jsx` (EDITED) — new optional `defaultSources` prop initialises the Sales/Projects/Schedule toggles (defaults all-on, so the Delivery blended Calendar is unchanged; the Sales Calendar tab opens sales-only and the user can still toggle the others on — same calendar, same data).
- `AppLayout.jsx` (EDITED) — `sales-calendar → 'sales'` in `VIEW_TO_PAGE` (Sales stays highlighted on the Calendar tab).
- `Sidebar.jsx` (EDITED) — calls `useIdyqConnection()` and filters the **Catalogue** admin item out when connected (kept for non-IDYQ orgs). Fail-safe: if the check errors it treats as not-connected, so Catalogue stays visible. Known minor caveat: the sidebar reads the connection once on load, so after connecting/disconnecting IDYQ mid-session the Catalogue item appears/disappears on the next page refresh.
- `IdyqIntegration.jsx` — **unchanged** (a stray prev-session `export` of `QuoteRow` was discarded; `SalesQuotes` reuses the whole `IdyqQuotesView` instead).
- Validation: all files `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean; lucide icon names verified; component props unchanged so wiring is limited to the Dashboard/AppLayout/Sidebar edits above. No migration, no SQL.

### 14.20 IDYQ cost/profit pull confirmed + refresh-on-pull (v2.2, BUILT)
**Confirmed live:** the IDYQ-repo `server/_core/worktrackrBridge.ts` `mapLine` already emits `cost_price` (= `l.costPrice`), `profit` (= `line_total − cost×qty`, penny-matched, null-safe) and `pricing_type` (= `l.pricingType`) — the exact snake_case keys the WorkTrackr sync reads. Verified end-to-end after a quote sync (Headway / IDYQ id 201): Microsoft 365 pulled at £8.57 unit cost, £39.26 line profit; monthly/annual line types tagged on the order. The earlier "£0 cost / profit = full sell" symptom was a **stale mirror** (the bridge fix went live after the last sync) — fixed by one **Sync quotes**, not a code change.
- `shared/idyq/idyqSync.js` (EDITED) — new exported `pullQuoteById({ organisationId, idyqId })`: fetches one quote from the bridge (`GET /api/external/quotes/:id`) and `upsertQuote`s it (which replaces its mirrored lines with current cost/profit/type). Mirrors `pullQuoteByNumber`'s by-id path. Re-exported automatically via `shared/idyq/index.js` (spreads the module).
- `web/routes/orders.js` (EDITED) — `POST /:id/pull-quote` calls `pullQuoteById` (best-effort, try/catch) **before** reading the mirror, so the pulled order lines are always current. Falls back to the existing mirror if IDYQ is briefly unreachable.
- `web/routes/contracts.js` (EDITED) — same refresh-on-pull before its mirror read + auto-sort.
- Net effect: pulling a quote into an order/contract no longer needs a manual "Sync quotes"; the 30-min scheduled `syncAllConnectedOrgs` (catalogue **and** quotes) still keeps the mirror warm for the read-only Quotes tab and the picker. (Brand-new quotes not yet in any sync still surface in the picker via the 30-min sweep.)
- Validation: `node --check` clean on all three files. No migration, no SQL.

### 14.21 Quote picker refresh (v2.3, BUILT)
So a brand-new IdoYourQuotes quote appears in the order/contract quote dropdown without waiting for the 30-min sweep or a manual "Sync quotes":
- `web/routes/idyq.js` (EDITED) — `GET /api/idyq/quotes` accepts `?refresh=1` (or `refresh=true`): runs `pullQuotes({ organisationId })` (best-effort, try/catch — falls back to the mirror if IDYQ is unreachable) before reading the mirror list. `pullQuotes` was already imported.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/OrderForm.jsx`, `ContractForm.jsx` (EDITED) — on open the picker loads the cached list instantly (`/api/idyq/quotes`) **and** fires a background `?refresh=1` fetch that updates the dropdown when it returns. Non-blocking; the refreshed list (which arrives last) wins.
- Net: open an order/contract → existing quotes show immediately → any brand-new quote pops in a moment later. Combined with refresh-on-pull (§14.20), the manual "Sync quotes" button is now only ever a "force it now" convenience.
- Validation: `node --check` clean on `idyq.js`; `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on both forms. No migration, no SQL.

### 14.22 Role-widening migration + dead-file cleanup (v2.4, BUILT)
**Role widening (the gate for Salesman/Engineer role screens):**
- `web/migrations/phase9_widen_membership_roles.sql` (NEW) — `ALTER TABLE memberships DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS memberships_role_check;` then re-adds it as `CHECK (role IN ('admin','manager','staff','salesman','engineer'))`. Idempotent; relies on Postgres' default inline-CHECK name `memberships_role_check` (same pattern `remove_products_type_constraint.sql` uses). Adds no role to anyone — only permits the two new values. Auto-runs on boot via `web/run-migrations.js`.
- `database/schema.sql` (EDITED) — the `memberships` inline CHECK widened to match, so fresh DBs build with all five roles.
- Validated with a real Postgres grammar parse (libpg_query/pg-query-emscripten): migration = 2 statements, schema = 37 statements, both clean.
- **Not** built yet (the remaining feature on top): the Users role selector + role-based home routing. The constraint no longer blocks them.

**Dead-file cleanup (11 files removed — orphaned, nothing imported them):**
- Orphaned Deals: `web/client/src/app/src/components/DealsList.jsx`, `DealForm.jsx` (superseded by Leads); `web/routes/deals.js`; and the mount removed from `web/server.js` (`/api/deals` require + `app.use`). The `deals` **table is left intact** (dropping data is destructive and harmless to keep).
- Stray editor snapshots: `CRMDashboard.jsx.broken`, `CreateTicketModal.jsx.broken`, `TicketDesigner.jsx.broken`, `TicketDetailModal.jsx.broken`, `BillingQueueManager.jsx.backup`, `XeroIntegration.jsx.backup`, `web/client/src/app/src/data/mockData.js.broken`, `web/routes/tickets_bulk_original.js.backup`. (`.broken`/`.backup` extensions are unimportable, so removal is runtime-safe; each had a live counterpart except the `tickets_bulk_original` backup.)
- `web/server.js` (EDITED) — deals route require + mount removed; `node --check` clean. No other code referenced any removed file (grep-verified).

### 14.23 Role selector + role-based home + orders pull-quote fix (v2.5, BUILT)
**Users role selector (the four+legacy roles are now assignable in the Users screen):**
- `web/routes/organizations.js` (EDITED) — added an `ALLOWED_MEMBERSHIP_ROLES` whitelist (`admin`,`manager`,`staff`,`salesman`,`engineer`) and validate against it on both **invite** (`POST /:id/users/invite`) and **update** (`PUT /:id/users/:userId`); a bad value now returns a clean 400 instead of a DB-CHECK 500. `owner`/`partner_admin` remain non-assignable (derived/special).
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/UserManagementImproved.jsx` (EDITED) — the **Add User** modal and the **Edit user** form now offer all five roles via a dropdown (was Admin/Staff only). The old inline Admin/Staff `Switch` in the row was **local-only (never persisted)** — replaced with a read-only role **badge**; role changes now go through Edit → pick role → Save (the existing PUT that already sent `role`). Owner and self are locked.
- Note: the Users screen is already admin-gated client-side (`currentView==='users' && isAdmin`). The server still allows admin **or** manager to edit users (pre-existing; not changed this batch).

**Role-based home screens (now unblocked by the v2.4 role widening):**
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/DashboardWithLayout.jsx` (EDITED) — landing view is now role-aware: **Salesman → My Pay**, **Engineer → My Pay**, everyone else → Tickets (unchanged). Lazy-init from cached membership + a one-shot effect once membership loads; never overrides a deep-link (`location.state.view`) or a later user click.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/MyPay.jsx` (EDITED) — visible tabs follow the role: **salesman = Commission only**, **engineer = Wage only** (enforces "engineers must NOT see commission/profit", §6.2), admin/manager/staff = both. Default tab = first allowed. Reuses `BonusScreen`/`EngineerWage` unchanged.
- **Still pending (recommended next batch):** full per-role **sidebar/route gating**. Today the home screen lands correctly and My Pay hides commission from engineers, but the rest of the nav is not yet locked down — an engineer could still navigate to Sales and see company profit. Gating Sidebar items + guarding routes per role is a larger, higher-risk change, kept separate on purpose.

**Orders pull-quote duplicate route fixed:**
- `web/routes/orders.js` (EDITED) — there were **two** `POST /:id/pull-quote` handlers; Express ran the first (v2.2 refresh-on-pull) and the second was dead. The dead one was the only one that **set the order's company from the quote's linked contact**, so "Act on this quote → Order" (IdyqIntegration) was silently creating orders with no company. Merged that auto-fill into the live refresh-on-pull handler (and it now returns a `pulled` count, like the old one) and **deleted the dead duplicate**. The Contract path was already correct. `node --check` clean; one pull-quote route remains.

**Validation:** `node --check` clean on `organizations.js`, `orders.js`; `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on `UserManagementImproved.jsx`, `MyPay.jsx`, `DashboardWithLayout.jsx`. No new lucide icons introduced. No migration / no SQL this batch.

### 14.24 Engineer profit lockdown — per-role nav + route gating (v2.6, BUILT)
Engineers are now a **delivery-only** role: they cannot see company/order/contract/quote/invoice **profit** anywhere in the app. Two layers so it holds against deep-links and click-throughs, not just a hidden menu:
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` (EDITED) — new `isEngineer` prop; the whole **Sales** and **Finance** sections are hidden for engineers. They keep **Workspace** (My Tasks, My Pay → Wage-only per v2.5, My Notes) and **Delivery** (Tickets, Projects, Calendar). Settings was already manager/admin-only.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (EDITED) — a deny-by-default **whitelist** `ENGINEER_ALLOWED_VIEWS = [tickets, jobs, calendar, my-tasks, my-pay, my-wage, my-notes]`. An effect bounces an engineer off any other view to Tickets, and the render refuses to draw a blocked screen even for one frame. Catches deep-links (`location.state.view`), role-resolves-after-nav, and any future sales click-through.
- `web/client/src/app/src/components/AppLayout.jsx`, `DashboardWithLayout.jsx` (EDITED) — thread `isEngineer` (from `membership.role`) down to the Sidebar.
- **Only engineers are restricted.** Salesmen still see Sales/profit (commission depends on it); admins/managers unchanged.
- **Scope boundary:** this removes every *screen* that shows profit. It does not separately audit field-level profit that might appear inside an allowed Delivery screen (e.g. a margin on a Project card) — none expected, gate per-field later if any surfaces.
- Validation: `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on all four. No new lucide icons. No migration / no SQL.

### 14.26 Session findings — deploy/build + billing/enforcement diagnosis (v2.7, DIAGNOSIS ONLY, no code change)
This entry records what was learned in a long live-debugging session. **Nothing here was code-fixed yet** except where noted; treat the billing/enforcement items as the next batch. Re-verify before acting — one earlier conclusion in this session was wrong (see the verification caution).

**Deploy & build reality (important operational knowledge):**
- The web service is a Render **Starter instance (0.5 CPU / 512 MB)**. `vite build` for this client needs **more than 512 MB** and OOMs ("heap out of memory") if run in the runtime container. Render's own build step runs with more memory and builds fine — the deployed bundle has been correct.
- **NEVER run `npm run build` / `vite build` in the Render *Shell*.** Vite empties `web/client/dist` first, then the OOM leaves it empty → the site goes blank (this happened and caused an outage). Recovery: **Manual Deploy → "Deploy latest commit"** (Render rebuilds with enough memory and restores `dist`).
- **`web/client/dist` is committed to git but is INCOMPLETE** — its `index.html` references `index-*.js`/`index-*.css` main files that were never committed (only side-chunks/icons are). So `git checkout -- web/client/dist` does NOT restore a working app. Recommended cleanup: `git rm -r --cached web/client/dist` (commit/push) so Render's fresh build is the only source — but only after confirming Render builds reliably (it does today).
- Server serves `web/client/dist` (built by Vite); the **backend runs straight from source** via `node web/server.js` (so backend changes go live without a build; only the React UI needs the build).
- **VERIFICATION CAUTION (the mistake this session):** production bundles are **minified**, so checking for a change by grepping the built JS for a **variable name** (e.g. `ROLE_OPTIONS`) gives a false negative — the identifier is renamed. Verify with **string literals** that survive minification (e.g. "Salesman", "owner's role can't be changed", "This area isn't available"). By that test, the v2.5/v2.6 changes ARE present in the live bundle. The "roles didn't change after push" symptom was most likely **browser cache** — hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) / private window. **Confirm in a fresh session that the role dropdown + engineer lockdown actually render in the live UI.**

**Subscription enforcement is BROKEN — does not block anyone (next batch to build):**
- `web/middleware/trialCheck.js` is mounted on all `/api/` routes but reads `req.orgContext?.organisationId` (British 's') while `shared/db.js` `getOrgContext` returns `organizationId` (American 'z'). So `orgId` is always undefined and the gate returns `next()` immediately — **it's a no-op for every request.** This is the primary reason an expired trial doesn't restrict access.
- Even if the spelling is fixed, the gate treats *any* non-null `stripe_subscription_id` as "valid" without checking Stripe says active; and the cancellation webhook (`webhooks.js handleSubscriptionDeleted`) nulls `trial_start`/`trial_end` AND `stripe_subscription_id`, so a cancelled org has neither → the "expired" branch never runs → falls through to full access. `handlePaymentFailed` only logs (a failed renewal doesn't revoke).
- **Billing round-trip is half-wired:** the live `sweetbyteltd` org (`a777ef53…`) has **no `stripe_customer_id`/`stripe_subscription_id`** — its "Enterprise/Current Plan" was set by the no-payment trial-plan selector (`/upgrade-trial-plan`), not a real subscription. So **"Manage Billing" → `/api/billing/portal` returns 400 (no customer) and nothing happens.** The portal is only for existing subscribers; getting a customer requires completing **Checkout** (`/api/billing/checkout`), whose customer/subscription ids are written back by the `checkout.session.completed` webhook. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` IS set in Render; still need to confirm a webhook **endpoint** is registered in Stripe (Developers → Webhooks) pointing at the live `/api/webhooks` and subscribed to the subscription/checkout events.
- **Goal (user):** future customers must not be able to use WorkTrackr without a valid paid subscription. Proposed batch: fix the spelling so the gate runs; define "valid" as actually-active in Stripe (not just an id present); treat "no subscription + no/expired trial" as blocked; handle `payment_failed`/`past_due`; make "Manage Billing" send no-customer orgs to Checkout. **Critical safeguard:** turning enforcement on would immediately lock out the owner's own dev org (trial expired, no live subscription) — include an admin/grace override or require a real subscription first, agreed with the user before building. No hardcoded money — every figure per-org config.

**DB drift note:** the live database was built incrementally from `web/migrations/*.sql` and does NOT match `database/schema.sql` (e.g. live `memberships` has **no `status` column**, so queries selecting `m.status` error). `database/schema.sql` is only used for fresh DBs; for the existing DB, the migrations are the source of truth.

---

### 14.27 Billing + subscription enforcement (v2.8, BUILT)
The subscription wall is now real. Diagnosis in §14.26 was re-verified in a fresh session; **the gate was a no-op for FOUR reasons, not one** (the previous session only logged the spelling). Corrections found this session: (a) the gate was mounted *below* `/api/tickets`, `/api/organizations`, `/api/contacts`, `/api/pricing`, so those bypassed it regardless; (b) inside `app.use('/api/', …)` Express strips the `/api` prefix, so every `req.path.startsWith('/api/…')` check (exemptions AND the 402 trigger) silently failed — a one-line spelling fix would have changed nothing; (c) the live "Manage Billing" button was an unwired `alert()` stub, not a 400; (d) two more same-class property bugs exist (`email-intake.js` and `quotes-from-ticket.js` read an org id that isn't on the object) — **left for a separate small batch.**

**What was built:**
- `web/migrations/phase10_billing_enforcement.sql` (NEW) — adds `organisations.billing_exempt` (bool, default false) and `organisations.subscription_status` (text, Stripe-mirrored), and sets `billing_exempt = true` for the owner dev org `a777ef53…`. Order-independent + idempotent.
- `web/middleware/trialCheck.js` (REPLACED) — now exports `assertAccess(orgId)` (a decision, not middleware) + an updated `getTrialStatus`. Access order: exempt → bad statuses block (`past_due`/`unpaid`/`canceled`/`incomplete_expired`) → good statuses allow (`active`/`trialing`) → legacy fallback (sub id + unexpired period) → live trial → else block (402 `subscription_required`).
- `web/server.js` (REPLACED) — the wall now runs **inside `authenticateToken`**, right after org context is set, so it covers every protected route regardless of mount order and reads `req.originalUrl` (prefix intact). `/api/auth`, `/api/billing`, `/api/trial` are exempt so a blocked org can still log in, see status, and pay. The old broken `app.use('/api/', checkTrialStatus)` mount was removed.
- `web/routes/webhooks.js` (REPLACED) — `subscription_status` is now written: checkout→`active`, subscription.updated→Stripe's `status`, subscription.deleted→`canceled` (was: wiped everything → accidental full access), payment_failed→`past_due` (**blocks immediately — owner's chosen policy: "use another card"**), payment_succeeded→`active`. Also accepts `organisation_id` as well as `orgId` in subscription metadata.
- `web/routes/billing.js` (EDITED) — `/portal` returns `{ needsCheckout: true }` instead of a dead 400 when there's no Stripe customer.
- `web/routes/admin.js`, `web/routes/adminSetTrial.js`, `web/routes/migrations.js` (EDITED) — the admin back-door no longer has a weak baked-in default key; it refuses (503) unless `ADMIN_API_KEY` is set in the environment.
- `web/client/.../main.jsx` (REPLACED) — global `fetch` wrapper fires a `wt:subscription-blocked` event on a 402 `subscription_required`.
- `web/client/.../App.jsx` (EDITED) — new `BillingGate` shows the existing `PlanManagement` pay screen full-screen when blocked (event-driven + a proactive `/api/trial/status` check). Exempt orgs read as active and never see it.
- `web/client/.../components/PlanManagement.jsx` (EDITED) — "Manage Billing" wired: open Stripe portal if a customer exists, else fall through to checkout.

**Owner lock-out safeguards (three layers):** `billing_exempt = true` on the owner org (set in the migration, live the instant the wall exists); the **100-year trial** applied 24 Jun 2026 via `/api/admin/set-trial` (interim, belt-and-braces); and exempt is checked first in `assertAccess`.

**Deploy steps for this batch:** (1) set `ADMIN_API_KEY` in Render *before/with* this deploy or the admin back-door stops working; (2) redeploy via Render "Deploy latest commit" (migration runs on boot); (3) confirm in Stripe which webhook URL is registered — the real endpoints are `/webhooks/stripe` (subscription lifecycle) and `/api/auth/stripe/webhook` (signup provisioning); the v2.6 note's `/api/webhooks` does **not** exist.

**Validation:** `node --check` clean on all 7 backend files; `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on `main.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `PlanManagement.jsx`; real Postgres-grammar parse (libpg-query) clean on the migration (3 statements); no new lucide icons.

### 14.28 Session findings — frontend deploy freshness & the "roles not showing" question (v2.9)
Re-verified the "user roles not all showing" symptom. **It is not a code bug and not the Render Starter plan.** It's a deploy-freshness question, and the tool that should answer it is broken.

- **The Users screen renders `UserManagementImproved.jsx`** (confirmed wired in `Dashboard.jsx`; the other two copies `UserManagement.jsx` and `UserManagementSimple.jsx` are dead/unused). That component lists **all five roles unconditionally** in both the Edit (pencil) dropdown and the Add-User dropdown — no plan gating. In the member **list**, each person shows their assigned role as a **read-only badge** by design (this is the v2.5 behaviour); the five options only appear on Edit/Add. So "only Staff/Admin in the list" is expected — check the Edit/Add dropdown.
- **The version footer is a hardcoded lie.** `web/client/.../components/AppVersion.jsx` contains `APP_VERSION = '2025-11-08.FIXED'` as a literal string. It never changes on deploy, so it cannot tell you whether the live site is current. This almost certainly muddied the earlier diagnosis. **Recommendation: wire it to a real build-time value, or bump it every release.**
- **Cache busts itself.** Built assets are content-hashed and `index.html` is served `no-store` (`server.js`), so a *successful* deploy forces browsers to pick up new files automatically — a hard refresh shouldn't be needed. Therefore, if a recent frontend change still doesn't appear after a deploy, the likely cause is **the build not producing a new bundle (failed/stale deploy)**, NOT browser cache.
- **Render Starter (512 MB) re-examined.** True that `vite build` OOMs if run in the *runtime shell* (the "never build in the shell" rule). But normal deploys build in Render's **separate build step** (build command `npm install && cd web/client && npm install && npm run build`), which has worked historically and injects Stripe price IDs at build time. So "Starter plan → roles don't deploy" was a conflation of the shell-build problem with the deploy build. Whether the deploy build is currently succeeding is **unconfirmed** (no access to Render build logs).
- **DEFINITIVE TEST (open action):** change the `AppVersion.jsx` string to a new value, deploy via Render, check the footer. Footer changes ⇒ deploys land (roles appear in Edit/Add dropdown; one hard refresh if needed) ⇒ symptom was a misread of the list. Footer unchanged ⇒ **frontend is not being rebuilt on deploy** ⇒ none of v2.5 / v2.6 / **v2.8 billing screen** is live ⇒ inspect Render build logs for an OOM/build error. This test also gates whether the v2.8 `BillingGate` will ever appear.

## 15. Current state / START HERE (for a fresh session)

> ## ✅ CURRENT STATE (post-Manus) — the redesign is DONE; we're in FEATURE/POLISH mode. READ THIS FIRST.
>
> **Manus AI's dark "Relationship Hub" redesign (two rounds) is integrated and verified, and every remaining light screen has been darkened.** The whole app is now dark, full-width, end-to-end. `App.css` is globally dark. We are **no longer reskinning** — the work now is **feature-building, fixing broken flows, and polish**, one focused change per turn on the owner's go-ahead.
>
> - The earlier "page-by-page reskin" / "don't flip the whole app dark" / "wait for Manus" instructions are **superseded and no longer apply.**
> - Manus's round-2 return was a full repo; it was verified to leave the **backend byte-for-byte identical** — only the frontend was taken, the owner's `docs/` kept.
> - The backend stayed **untouched** through the whole redesign, until this session's **one** backend change (company file attachments — durable DB-backed storage). Backend changes are now allowed but should stay **rare, minimal, and flagged to the owner.**
>
> **How we hand over now (changed by owner request):** hand over **only the changed files**, not full zips, with a filename→folder list (flag anything outside `web/client/src/app/src/components/`, e.g. backend files). Validate first (frontend `npm run build` = "1846 modules transformed, zero errors"; backend `node -c`). **Bump the build stamp** in `AppVersion.jsx` each change (it now shows faintly in the **sidebar footer**, expanded only). Current stamp: **`2026-06-27.version-stamp-quiet`**.
>
> **Guardrails unchanged:** no hardcoded money; role-gating intact (engineers never see commission/profit); no invented data; `PUT /api/contacts/:id` replaces the whole `crm` object (spread + change one field); stage `new` shows as "Suspect"; every feature must actually work against a real mounted endpoint.
>
> **Key infra facts:** migrations auto-run on boot (`web/run-migrations.js` runs any new `.sql` in `web/migrations/` once, tracked in `schema_migrations`; a failing migration crashes boot, so keep them idempotent). DB column is British `organisation_id`; `getOrgContext()` returns `.organizationId`. Render auto-deploys on push from GitHub Desktop.
>
> **What's built this session, the open items (cleanup script in `docs/`; optional external file storage; two sales-flow gaps), and the full per-screen feature/endpoint catalogue are in HANDOVER.md and the §17.6 build log (see the v4.3–v4.7 entries at the top of the log).** Everything below remains the source of truth for what each screen really does.

**🎨 BIGGEST CURRENT WORKSTREAM — full-app UI REDESIGN (BUILD STARTED v3.1).** See **§17** and **`docs/design/REDESIGN_HANDOVER.md`**. The whole app is being redesigned to a **fully dark, full-width** look (Concept 3 "Relationship Hub"), designed by **Manus AI** and signed off by the owner. The **company is the hub** (Leads tab removed → folded in; Contracts tab removed → services on the company). Sidebar → slim icon rail (expandable + hideable; bottom bar on mobile). Design assets + token sheet in `docs/design/`. **Build order is page-by-page (NOT a global theme flip — that would break the existing light screens).** **v3.1 = FOUNDATION batch built & handed over (additive, nothing wired to a page yet):** dark design tokens (`--wt-*` in `App.css`), Inter font loaded, optimized flourish asset, and the reusable `PageHero.jsx` (the dark gradient hero box + bilateral flourish). **v3.2 = COMPANY RECORD rebuilt** to the dark Concept-3 layout (PageHero + People/History&notes/Overview columns + Services&contracts band), all existing data wiring preserved, plus notepad (Save note), Add calendar reminder, and editable Source — all on existing endpoints. **This page is now dark/full-width; the rest of the app stays light until rebuilt.** **v3.3 = Add company full-page form built + dead button fixed** (Dashboard wires it). **v3.4 = dark pages now full-screen** (AppLayout drops the light padded wrapper via a `fullBleed` flag the Dashboard raises) **and the Leads + Contracts tabs are removed** (Sales tabs = Companies · Quotes · Orders · Calendar). Next: Companies-list + Quotes/Orders dark restyle (the shared SalesPageLayout/SalesTabs migration, done together so the chrome flips once). **v3.5 = company record gaps filled** — the company's own telephone/email/website shown + editable in the People box, and a dated **Next action** (note + chase date, overdue in red) with a **Book in calendar** button (saves to `crm.nextAction`/`crm.chaseDate`; posts a `follow_up` to `/api/crm-events`). **v3.6 = the SALES GROUP went dark together** — Companies list rebuilt to Manus's design (PIPELINE/kanban of Suspect/Prospect/Hot prospect/Customer columns with owner avatar, source pill, "x ago" activity, a working ⋯ menu, per-column Add company; **plus a LIST view (table)** carrying telephone/email/contact/next action + chase date (overdue red)/monthly value; a List/Pipeline toggle, search, an "All sources" dropdown filter). Quotes + Orders were **dark-reskinned in place** (identical data/actions/filters/columns — colours only). The shared frame (`SalesPageLayout` + `SalesTabs`) gained an **opt-in `dark` flag** so the three flip together while **Leads + Contracts stay light untouched** (they share the frame); the Dashboard raises full-bleed for companies/quotes/orders and passes `dark` to the tab bar (Calendar tab stays light over the light calendar — no half-dark state). **A parity inventory of each old screen was taken first and every feature re-ticked** (load, search, stage/status filters + counts, CSV Import, Add company, Create quote, New order, row→open, all columns, states) — the dropped-feature problem from the prior session was the trigger for this. **NEXT: continue the dark redesign as GROUPS (one per turn), each with its parity checklist** — the natural next group is **Workspace** (My Tasks · Approvals · My Pay · My Notes), then Delivery, Finance, Settings, Account; plus the **sidebar 3-state + mobile** and the **Calendar** dark pass (which also lets the Calendar tab's chrome go dark). **KEEP Manus's design — do NOT redesign.** Build to the Manus spec exactly, one group per turn, on the owner's go-ahead.

**v3.7 = WORKSPACE group started (My Tasks · Approvals · My Pay went dark).** **My Tasks** rebuilt to Manus's dark table (time tabs All/Today/This Week/Overdue, an "All tasks" status dropdown that also restores the Completed view, Status column *derived* from the real open/done model — Done/Overdue/To do, no invented "in progress" — assignee avatars, an Overdue group, the all-caught-up empty state); the add-task form + tick-to-complete + all data preserved. **Approvals** (`OrderQueues`) reskinned to Manus's dark **card** style (left accent, type pill, requester avatar, amber Approve / red Reject) **over the real order workflow** — the mockup illustrates expense/leave/quote approvals, but the app's real queues are order-based, so the three real queues (Approval + comment / Purchasing / Fulfilment) and every action were kept; nothing invented. **My Pay** dark-reskinned over its real role-gated content (the commission view `BonusScreen` + wage view `EngineerWage`, both recoloured, role gating intact: engineers still never see commission). Manus's My Pay extras (earnings-summary/YTD cards, payslip PDFs, next-payment block) were **deliberately NOT faked** — they need backend (payslip storage, YTD aggregates, pay-run dates) and are deferred. Dashboard raises full-bleed for `my-tasks`/`order-queues`/`my-pay`. **`My Notes` was deliberately HELD BACK** — Manus's My Notes is a two-pane editor with **categories, rich-text formatting and search** that the data model doesn't have, and building it as drawn would DELETE real features (due-date reminders + overdue banner, complete toggle, pin, **create-ticket-from-note**, **add-note-to-ticket**, **voice dictation**). It needs its own turn + a design decision (reskin-in-place keeping every feature, vs new backend for categories/rich-text). **NEXT: finish Workspace by doing My Notes (decision above), then Delivery (batch_b), Finance (batch_d), Settings (batch_e), Account (batch_f); plus sidebar 3-state + mobile + Calendar dark pass.**

**v3.8 = My Notes went dark + a new standing rule.** Standing rule locked in: **every feature must actually WORK, not just appear** — the redesign doubles as a sweep for broken flows (some are known broken), so each screen touched gets its actions verified against real mounted endpoints and anything broken is fixed or flagged. **My Notes** (`PersonalNotes`) was dark-reskinned **in place** with **all logic kept byte-for-byte** (so no flow could break from a colour change): private notes list, Active/Pinned/Reminders/Completed tabs, the overdue banner, complete toggle, pin, inline edit, delete, **create-ticket-from-note** + **add-note-to-ticket** modals, and **voice dictation** all preserved; `DictationButton` gained an opt-in `dark` prop (CompanyNotes stays light). Manus's two-pane/category/rich-text My Notes was **not** built (it would drop those features + needs new backend) — kept as a future option. Flows verified live against mounted routes (notes CRUD, tickets create/list/comments). **NEXT: Delivery group (batch_b: Tickets, Projects, Calendar) — the Calendar dark pass also lets the Sales Calendar tab go dark — then Finance, Settings, Account; plus sidebar 3-state + mobile.**

**v3.9 = Delivery group started — PROJECTS (list + detail) went dark.** Delivery is big enough to be three sub-pieces (Tickets, Projects, Calendar), so it's being done one piece per turn. **Projects list** (`JobsList`) rebuilt to Manus's dark **card grid** (`batch_b/projects_list`): company/contact avatar, title, status pill, single assignee, due date, project number; quick tabs (All/Active/On hold/Completed) + the full six-status dropdown + search + a sort dropdown + a stat strip (In progress / On hold / Overdue[computed] / Completed) + a dashed "New project" card. **Progress bars + multi-assignee stacks from the mockup were NOT faked** — the data model has neither (single `assignedToName`, no progress field); cards show real data only. **Project detail** (`JobDetail`) **dark-reskinned in place** — Manus drew a Tasks/Team/Milestones/Files project view, but the real screen is a field-service job (Overview + **time entries** + **parts/materials** + status workflow + **convert-to-invoice** + edit + delete), so all of that was kept and only the colours changed (logic byte-for-byte). `JobDetailWithLayout` now passes `fullBleed`; Dashboard raises full-bleed for `jobs`. All flows verified live. **NEXT in Delivery: Calendar (`CRMCalendar` — a focused surgical dark pass; also unblocks the Sales Calendar tab) and Tickets (list woven into Dashboard + `TicketsTableView` + `TicketDetailViewTabbed` + modals — the biggest, most critical screen, its own turn). Then Finance, Settings, Account; plus sidebar 3-state + mobile.**

**v4.0 = Delivery Calendar went dark + the Sales Calendar tab seam is CLOSED.** `CRMCalendar` (~1,400 lines) dark-reskinned **in place via a scripted colour-token swap — logic byte-for-byte** (all 11 flows untouched: events CRUD, contacts, jobs, AI summaries, source toggles). Event-type pills re-coloured to dark; the 6 shadcn `Select` dropdowns given dark overrides; today-cell + amber buttons fixed for dark contrast; a malformed `rgba()/opacity` class pair (pre-existing `/50`,`/40` suffixes) cleaned up. Wired full-bleed for `calendar`/`sales-calendar`/`crm-calendar`, and **the Sales `Calendar` tab bar now goes dark** (`SalesTabs dark` for `sales-calendar`) — the half-dark seam left open since v3.6 is gone, so the **whole Sales group is now fully dark**. (`IntegratedCalendar.jsx` is a separate, unwired calendar — not touched.) **NEXT: Tickets (the big one — list is inline in `Dashboard.jsx` + `TicketsTableView` + `TicketDetailViewTabbed` (~1,900) + modals; its own turn), then Finance (batch_d), Settings (batch_e), Account (batch_f); plus sidebar 3-state + mobile.**

**v2.8 VERIFICATION (done v3.0 session):** the 12 v2.8 billing/enforcement files ARE present in the repo and match their descriptions (`assertAccess` in `trialCheck.js`, wall inside `authenticateToken` reading `organizationId`, `phase10` migration with owner exempt, webhooks writing `subscription_status`, admin gate requiring `ADMIN_API_KEY`, client `BillingGate`). All validated clean. **Still NOT deployed/confirmed live** — deploy steps unchanged (set `ADMIN_API_KEY`, deploy, confirm Stripe webhook). Also re-confirmed: the two queued same-class bugs (`email-intake.js`, `quotes-from-ticket.js`) are the ONLY instances of those patterns; and `stripeSeats.js` DOES query `memberships.status` + `m.organization_id` (fails soft) — correcting the earlier "nothing queries it" note.

**Build position:** Phases 0–8 + Phase 8.1 (v2.1) + **v2.5 role selector/role-based home** + **v2.6 engineer profit lockdown** are built. **v2.8 billing + subscription enforcement is BUILT and present in the repo (verified v3.0), but NOT yet deployed or confirmed live by the owner.**

**⚠️ FIRST, before trusting anything visual is live — run the frontend-freshness test (§14.28):** the live footer "Build 2025-11-08.FIXED" is a hardcoded string and cannot confirm deploys. Bump `AppVersion.jsx`, redeploy, and check the footer changes. If it does NOT change, the frontend is not rebuilding on deploy and none of v2.5/v2.6/v2.8's UI is live — investigate Render build logs before doing anything else. This gates the "roles not showing" question and whether the v2.8 billing screen appears.

**v2.8 deploy checklist (owner action):** (1) set `ADMIN_API_KEY` in Render *before/with* deploy (suggested value handed over) or the admin back-door (set-trial/update-plan) stops working; (2) deploy via Render "Deploy latest commit" (the `phase10` migration runs on boot, adds `billing_exempt` + `subscription_status`, and sets the owner org exempt); (3) confirm in Stripe which webhook URL is registered — real endpoints are `/webhooks/stripe` (lifecycle) and `/api/auth/stripe/webhook` (signup); `/api/webhooks` does NOT exist.

**Subscription wall (v2.8):** real, enforced inside `authenticateToken`, blocks expired-trial / cancelled / failed-payment orgs (402; failed payment blocks immediately — owner's chosen policy). **Owner dev org cannot be locked out:** `billing_exempt=true` (set by the migration) + a 100-year trial applied 24 Jun 2026.

**Next small batch (queued, NOT built):** two same-class property bugs — `email-intake.js` settings endpoints always 401 (wrong org-id property + no `authenticateToken` on the mount) and `quotes-from-ticket.js` runs with no org (reads org id off the JWT, which only carries `{userId,email}`). Cheap; do as one clean batch.

**Other known-but-deferred items:** the hardcoded version label (§14.28) should be made real; committed `web/client/dist` is incomplete and should be untracked (`git rm -r --cached web/client/dist`) since Render rebuilds it; `database/schema.sql` lists a `memberships.status` column the live DB lacks (latent, nothing queries it yet); three user-management components exist but only `UserManagementImproved.jsx` is wired.

**Operational caution:** do NOT run `vite build` / `npm run build` in the Render shell (512 MB → OOM → wipes `dist` → outage); always rebuild via Render "Deploy latest commit".

**Repo & mechanics:** WorkTrackr = `worktrackr-app` (this repo), pushed via GitHub Desktop from `C:\repos\worktrackr-app`; Render auto-deploys on push; the `web` service runs `web/migrations/*.sql` **alphabetically on boot** (tracked in `schema_migrations`, skips already-applied) — so **no manual migration step** is needed. A "company" is a `contacts` row `type='company'` (never FK to the dropped `customers` table); CRM data lives in the `contacts.crm` JSONB. IDYQ integration is a read-only pull. Most orgs do NOT use IDYQ — never break the native Quotes/Catalogue/Quote-Templates.

**What "Leads" is (Phase 7 — important, replaces "Deals"):** A lead = a company at a chase stage. The sales-stage ladder is **New → Prospect → Hot prospect → Customer** (the old name *Suspect* was renamed *New* everywhere — value `new`). The Sidebar's old **Deals** item is now **Leads**, a company-centred chase list (`LeadsList.jsx`) showing company / contact / phone / email / stage / owner / **first contact** ("12 May" style) / next action / **chase date** (full UK `DD/MM/YYYY`, overdue in red); with stage chips + counts, search, "Mine only", sortable headers, an **Add lead** quick form (`AddLeadModal.jsx`), a guided **Convert to customer** (`ConvertToCustomerModal.jsx` — confirms contacts, flips `crm.salesStage='customer'`), confirmed **Delete→archive** (sets `crm.archived=true`; hidden from everyone; managers get an **Archived** view to restore or permanently delete), and a slide-over **Notes panel** (`LeadNotesPanel.jsx` — add notes, drag emails in; logged to `contact_notes` and shown in the company profile timeline). No money on a lead. The old `deals` table + `DealsList.jsx`/`DealForm.jsx` are now unused (left in place, harmless).

**What the sidebar looks like now (Phase 8 consolidation, BUILT):**
- **Workspace** — My Tasks, **Approvals** (manager-only, moved here), My Pay, My Notes.
- **Delivery** — Tickets, Projects, **Calendar** (the single blended month calendar — jobs + scheduled tickets + meetings + follow-ups on one grid, with **Sales / Projects / Schedule** toggles).
- **Sales** — a single **Sales** entry that opens a tabbed page: **Companies · Leads · Quotes · Orders · Contracts · Calendar** (tabs via `SalesTabs.jsx`; clicking a row still opens the full company profile). All six share one chrome (`SalesPageLayout.jsx`, the Leads look). Quotes shows only a quotes list (read-only IDYQ when connected, native otherwise). The Calendar tab is the blended month calendar pre-scoped to sales activity (Projects/Schedule toggles still available). **Catalogue** (Settings) is hidden when IdoYourQuotes is connected (it's a read-only IDYQ mirror for connected orgs); it stays for non-IDYQ orgs as their product price-book. The standalone **CRM settings** and **Catalogue** screens render single-section (no CRM mega-page chrome).
- **Finance** — Invoices.
- **Settings** (mgr/admin) — Commission rules, Engineer wages, CRM settings, Catalogue, Pricing, Users, Billing, Security, Email Intake.

**Still pending / future (non-blockers):**
- **Billing + subscription enforcement (NEXT BATCH, see §14.26):** the trial/subscription gate is a no-op (`organisationId` vs `organizationId` typo in `trialCheck.js`); "valid" isn't checked against Stripe; "Manage Billing" 400s for orgs with no Stripe customer; the live org has no Stripe linkage. Build with a lock-yourself-out safeguard. Confirm a Stripe webhook endpoint is registered.
- **Deploy hygiene:** `web/client/dist` is committed but incomplete; untrack it once Render builds are confirmed reliable. Never `vite build` in the 512 MB shell.
- **IDYQ quote cost/profit/type pull:** ✅ confirmed live end-to-end (v2.2). The IDYQ-repo `server/_core/worktrackrBridge.ts` emits `cost_price`/`profit`/`pricing_type`; the WorkTrackr mirror stores them; order/contract pulls show real cost/profit. Pulls now refresh-on-pull (re-sync the one quote first), so no manual "Sync quotes" is needed for an accurate pull.
- **`memberships.role` CHECK widening** — ✅ done in v2.4. Users **role selector + role-based home routing** ✅ built in v2.5. Per-role **navigation/route gating** ✅ built in v2.6: **engineers are delivery-only** — Sales + Finance hidden, and a whitelist route guard blocks any profit-bearing screen (deep-links included), so engineers cannot see company/order/contract/quote/invoice profit anywhere. Salesmen/managers/admins unchanged. Manager-gating still works off `admin`/`manager`/`owner`/`partner_admin`.
- **Notes panel emails** log the subject + text only; the original email **file is not stored** (no attachment storage wired). Add file storage if needed.
- Deferred **CRM "Customers" tab** cleanup + **ticket→company** click-through; IDYQ **org allow-list** before 3rd-party onboarding; **Xero/QuickBooks** connector.
- Pre-existing clutter (`*.broken`/`*.backup` files; orphaned Deals UI/route) — ✅ removed in v2.4.

**Stale docs — do NOT trust:** `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/APP-STATE.md` and `docs/database_schema.md` are pre-redesign (April). Trust **this roadmap (v2.9)** and the **code** over them.

**Working cadence (unchanged):** UX/design first, then build ONE batch per turn; validate every file (`node --check` for JS, `esbuild --jsx=automatic` for JSX, real Postgres-grammar parse for SQL) and check lucide icon names exist; hand over downloadable files with a plain `filename → folder` list flagging replacements; explain in app-flow terms, no jargon. **No hardcoded money** — every commission/bonus/threshold/rate is per-org config, zero by default. **Every feature must WORK, not just appear (v3.8):** the whole-app redesign is also a sweep for broken flows — some are known broken. For every screen touched, confirm each button/action hits a real, mounted endpoint with matching field names + response shape (check `web/server.js` mounts + the route file), and FIX or explicitly FLAG anything broken — never leave a dead control silently. When reskinning, keep the working request/response logic verbatim and change only styling. Keep this roadmap the single source of truth and bump its version (and filename) by 0.1 on every update.

## 16. Phase 6 (SLIMMED per user — v1.7) — Deals + CSV import

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED in v2.0:** the **Deals** concept below was reframed as **Leads** (Phase 7, §14.14). The `deals` table and `DealsList.jsx`/`DealForm.jsx` still exist but are **unused** (left in place, harmless). The **CSV import** is still live, now reached via the **Import** button on the **Companies** tab. This section is kept for history.

Scope was cut right back at the user's request: keep only the essentials, drop the extras.

**Deals (BUILT, batch 1):** a lightweight deal = company, title, value (£), stage (**Open → In progress → Won → Lost**), expected close date, owner, notes. The Deals page lists them with one headline number — **open pipeline = Σ value of Open + In-progress deals**. That single number is the "forecast". **Dropped:** probability/weighting, weighted forecast, closing-this-quarter, win-rate, kanban board, auto-convert to order/contract, linked-quote value. `value` is user-entered deal data (not a commission figure).
- Files: `web/migrations/phase6_deals_tables.sql` (NEW — `deals` table), `web/routes/deals.js` (NEW — CRUD + stage changes; owner defaults to creator; won/lost stamped), `web/server.js` (mounts `/api/deals`), `web/client/src/app/src/components/DealsList.jsx` + `DealForm.jsx` (NEW), nav wired (Sidebar **Deals** in Sales after Companies, AppLayout map, Dashboard render). Validated (`node --check`, `esbuild --jsx`, real Postgres-grammar parse; menu item resolves).

**CSV import (BUILT, batch 2):** import companies from a spreadsheet — **upload a CSV (or paste)** → **map columns** to fields (auto-guessed by header) → **import**, with duplicates skipped server-side (by name/email). Lives as an **Import** button on the Companies page (no new menu item). Imports name, email, phone, contact person, website, sales stage, notes.
- Files: `web/routes/contacts.js` (EDITED — new `POST /import`: bulk-creates company contacts, dedupes by name/email within the org, returns `{created, skipped, errors}`), `web/client/src/app/src/components/CsvImport.jsx` (NEW — 3-step wizard, in-browser CSV parse, column mapping, result summary), `web/client/src/app/src/components/CompanyPipelineList.jsx` (EDITED — **Import** button + reload after import). Validated (`node --check`, `esbuild --jsx`, real Postgres-grammar parse).

*Status: Phase 6 (slim) COMPLETE — Deals + CSV import both built.*

## 17. UI Redesign program (v3.0) — design LOCKED, build PENDING

**One-line status:** the whole app is being visually redesigned; the design is complete
and signed off; **no redesign code has been written yet.** Full detail lives in
`docs/design/REDESIGN_HANDOVER.md` and `docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.pdf`. This section is
the roadmap's pointer to it.

### 17.1 What was decided
- **Look:** fully **dark**, **full-width**, immersive — Concept 3 "Relationship Hub".
- **Designer:** Manus AI. Claude builds to that spec exactly (not Claude's preview styling).
- **Company is the hub:** the **Leads** tab is removed (lead fields fold into the company
  record); the **Contracts** tab is removed (services & contracts show on the record).
- **Sidebar:** slim icon rail by default → expandable on hover/toggle → fully hideable
  for 100% full-width; bottom tab bar + drawer on mobile. (Replaces the old fixed sidebar.)
- **Stage rename:** "New" → **Suspect**. Ladder: Suspect → Prospect → Hot prospect → Customer.
- **Sources:** Telesales, Door knocking, E-shot, Social media, Website, Referral.
- **Currency £ only; no hardcoded money** (every figure per-org, zero default).
- **Role-aware nav:** engineers = Delivery only (no Sales/Finance/profit).
- **Add company** = full-page form.

### 17.2 Design assets in the repo (`docs/design/`)
- `REDESIGN_HANDOVER.md` — the master design reference + tokens (in plain text) + build order.
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.pdf` — the Manus spec (colours, Inter type scale, spacing, radii, components, sidebar states).
- `assets/` — all 51 screen exports (desktop + mobile), organised by batch
  (foundation, workspace, delivery, sales, finance, settings, account) + `flourish/`
  (`wriggly_flourish.png` verified transparent, `wriggly_flourish.svg`). See
  `assets/README.md` for the file checklist.

### 17.3 Company record layout (flagship)
Hero bar (company icon, name, Status pill, Source, Account manager, Edit/More/Add activity)
→ three columns **People · History & notes · Overview** → full-width **Services & contracts**
band. Mobile stacks People → History → Overview → Services. Numbers shown = Monthly profit,
Active services, Open tasks (all £/placeholder).

### 17.4 Build order (only on owner go-ahead, ONE batch per turn)
1. Foundation: CSS tokens + Inter + flourish asset + dark shell + sidebar (3 states + mobile).
2. Company record (desktop + mobile).
3. Sales: Companies pipeline · Add company (full page) · Quotes · Orders; remove Leads + Contracts tabs.
4. Workspace · Delivery · Finance · Settings · Account screens.

### 17.5 Carry-over CODE items (independent of the redesign — see §14.27 / §15)
- v2.8 billing batch present but NOT deployed (set `ADMIN_API_KEY`, deploy, confirm Stripe webhook).
- Small bug batch queued: `email-intake.js` (wrong org-id property + no `authenticateToken` on mount) and `quotes-from-ticket.js` (reads org id off the JWT).
- `stripeSeats.js` queries `memberships.status` + `m.organization_id` (fails soft).
- AppVersion freshness test still un-run (footer `2025-11-08.FIXED`).
- Committed `web/client/dist` incomplete — untrack once Render builds confirmed.

*Status: redesign DESIGN complete; BUILD started (v3.1 foundation done — see build log below).*

### 17.6 Build log

> **POST-MANUS SESSION (v4.3–v4.7) — newest first. The redesign is integrated; these are the feature/fix/polish changes since. Each shipped as changed-files only and bumped the `AppVersion.jsx` build stamp.**

- **v4.7 — Build stamp moved out of the flashing spot (BUILT).** The "Build …" version line was pinned to the bottom of Dashboard's per-view content, so it flashed on screen during menu navigation (the content area briefly empties on view-switch, leaving the stamp as the only visible thing). Moved into the **persistent sidebar footer** (expanded only, dimmed) so it can't flash. `AppVersion.jsx` → inline dim line; removed `<AppVersion/>` + its import from `Dashboard.jsx`; imported + rendered `{!isCollapsed && <AppVersion/>}` in `Sidebar.jsx`. Build stamp: `2026-06-27.version-stamp-quiet`. Files: AppVersion.jsx, Sidebar.jsx, Dashboard.jsx (all `web/client/src/app/src/components/`).

- **v4.6 — Company file attachments — FIRST BACKEND CHANGE (BUILT).** The app had **no durable file storage** (every existing upload wrote to ephemeral `/tmp`; the `attachments` table only held an unused `file_url`). Files now store **in Postgres (BYTEA)** so they survive Render deploys, capped at 10 MB.
  - `web/migrations/100_create_contact_attachments.sql` (**NEW**) — `contact_attachments` table (id `gen_random_uuid()`, `contact_id` FK→contacts ON DELETE CASCADE, `organisation_id`, `uploader_id`, filename, mime_type, size_bytes, note, `data BYTEA`, created_at) + index. Auto-creates on deploy.
  - `web/routes/contact-attachments.js` (**NEW**) — multer memoryStorage (10 MB); `GET /:id/attachments` (metadata only) · `POST /:id/attachments` (file + optional note; verifies contact belongs to org) · `GET /:id/attachments/:attId/download` (streams bytea) · `DELETE /:id/attachments/:attId`. All org-scoped via `getOrgContext`.
  - `web/server.js` (**EDITED, +2 lines**) — `require` + `app.use('/api/contacts', authenticateToken, contactAttachmentsRoutes)` (mounted after the existing contacts router; the new `/:id/attachments` sub-paths don't collide).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/CompanyProfile.jsx` (REPLACED) — replaced the old invisible email-text drop with a **visible** drag-and-drop / click-to-browse zone (Paperclip), an **optional note** saved with the file(s), and a file list with **download** + **delete**; uploads via `FormData`. `node -c` + frontend build clean; only the attachment endpoints are new. Future option (flagged): external object storage (S3/R2/Cloudinary) if large-file volume grows.

- **v4.5 — Company record + Companies list: archive safety net, view memory, timed calendar (BUILT).** All in `web/client/src/app/src/components/`; no backend change.
  - **Delete company → archive (soft-delete).** Reuses the backend's existing archive rule (`crm.archived`; hidden from staff; managers/admins see `?archived=only`; hard `DELETE /:id` exists). `CompanyProfile.jsx`: hero **Delete** button → archive → back. `CompanyPipelineList.jsx`: per-company **Delete** in the card ⋯ menu (archive); managers/admins get an **Archived** view with **Restore** + **Delete permanently** (`Dashboard.jsx` passes `isManager`).
  - **Companies list remembers list vs pipeline** (`localStorage` `wt_companies_view`).
  - **Calendar entries are always timed.** Note→calendar, Add-calendar-reminder, and Set-next-action booking each got a **time** field (default 09:00); events are now a 1-hour timed window (`all_day:false`), not fixed all-day 9am. `CRMCalendar.jsx`: events now match a calendar day by **local** date (was UTC) so timed entries land on the right day; note-to-calendar surfaces errors instead of swallowing them. Notes timeline already shows a precise date+time stamp.

- **v4.4 — Sidebar 3-state + chrome polish (BUILT).** `web/client/src/app/src/components/`.
  - **3-state collapsible sidebar built** (Manus never built it): desktop **rail (64px, default) / expanded (240px) / hidden (0, floating restore button)**, persisted to `localStorage` `wt_sidebar_mode`; mobile keeps the drawer. `AppLayout.jsx` rewritten; `Sidebar.jsx` got header controls (collapse-to-rail toggle + hide) and `onToggleWidth`/`onHide` props; navigation logic preserved identical. Icons confirmed in lucide 0.510.
  - **Scrollbars** widened 6→12px (`App.css`). **Sidebar colour** fixed near-black `#111113`→navy `#1a1a2e`, borders `#222228`→`#2e2e4a` (`Sidebar.jsx` + `AppLayout.jsx` mobile header; logo SVG fills left alone).

- **v4.3 — Manus redesign integrated + all leftover light screens darkened; app now globally dark (BUILT).**
  - **Manus rounds 1 & 2 integrated and verified.** Round 2 came back as a FULL repo; the **backend (server.js, all 45 routes, middleware, services, migrations, shared, worker, database) was verified byte-for-byte identical** — only the frontend (`App.css` + ~40 component `.jsx`) was taken, the owner's `docs/` kept. Verified: build clean; all data calls/endpoints/role-gating/handlers identical; no hardcoded money / invented data; the correct wired dark variants in place (CreateTicketModal, TicketDetailViewTabbed, TicketDetailModal, UserManagementImproved). Dropped a stray `.bak`.
  - **All remaining light screens darkened** using Manus's exact extracted token map (neutral scaffolding → dark; semantic red/green/blue accents kept): OrderForm, ContractForm, WorkflowBuilder, ContactSelector, AIQuoteGenerator, CsvImport, EmailLogModal, SafetyTabComprehensive, XeroIntegration, QuoteTemplatesManager, BillingQueueManager, QuickAddContactModal, PlanManagement, IntegratedCalendar, SendQuoteModal, ContractsList (opted into dark via `SalesPageLayout` `dark` prop), and the **deprecated Leads family** (darkened but **unreachable** — tabs removed). Shared `SalesPageLayout`/`SalesTabs` keep their light-default path (opt-in `dark`).

- **v3.1 — Foundation batch (BUILT, handed over; additive, safe).** Files:
  - `web/client/src/app/src/App.css` (EDITED) — added `--wt-*` redesign tokens to `:root` (new, prefixed; nothing existing changed). Tailwind v4; existing light theme untouched.
  - `web/client/index.html` (EDITED) — load **Inter** (the font stack already named it; now it actually loads). One intended visible change: body text renders in Inter app-wide.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/assets/wriggly_flourish.webp` (NEW) — flourish optimized to 1600px/~307 KB (master full-res stays in `docs/design/`).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/assets/wriggly_flourish.svg` (NEW) — vector copy (lightweight).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/PageHero.jsx` (NEW) — reusable dark hero box: amber radial-glow gradient, **bilateral flourish** (mirrored both corners), gold hairline, stage pill, meta row, action-button slots + `HeroButtonOutline`/`HeroButtonPrimary` helpers. Self-styled with `--wt-*` (hex fallbacks) so it renders on any page regardless of the surrounding light theme.
  - Validation: `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on `PageHero.jsx`; lucide icons (Building2, Pencil, MoreHorizontal, Plus) confirmed in lucide-react 0.510.0; `App.css` braces balanced + postcss parse clean.
  - **Not yet wired to any page** — deploying this changes nothing visible except the Inter font. PageHero goes live in the next batch (company record).
  - DELETE list: none.

- **v3.2 — Company record (BUILT).** `web/client/src/app/src/components/CompanyProfile.jsx` (REPLACED) — rebuilt to the dark full-width Concept-3 layout using `PageHero`. Three columns (People · History & notes · Overview) + full-width Services & contracts band; stage label shows **Suspect** (value still `new`); editable **Source** dropdown (saves `crm.source` via the existing contacts PUT); **Save note** → `POST /api/contacts/:id/notes`; **Add calendar reminder** → `POST /api/crm-events` (linked `follow_up`, shows on CRM calendar + timeline). All prior handlers (stage, people add/edit/remove, tasks add/toggle, services from active contracts) preserved exactly; props unchanged `{companyId,onBack,onNewOrder,onNewContract}`. **Depends on v3.1** (PageHero, `--wt-*` tokens, flourish asset) — deploy together. Validation: esbuild JSX clean; full bundle with PageHero clean (named export + webp asset resolve); 18 lucide icons confirmed in 0.510. DELETE list: none.

- **v3.3 — Add company (BUILT; fixes the dead button).** `web/client/src/app/src/components/AddCompanyPage.jsx` (NEW) — dark full-page form (name required; telephone/email/website; Source + Stage dropdowns; repeatable Contacts with Primary flag). Creates via `POST /api/contacts` (existing `contactSchema`: `type='company'`, `crm.salesStage`/`crm.source`, `contactPersons[]`); website auto-prefixed `https://`; on success opens the new company's record. `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (REPLACED) — added `addingCompany` state, imported `AddCompanyPage`, hid Sales tabs while adding, and made the companies view three-way (add → profile → list); now passes `onAddCompany` to `CompanyPipelineList` (the button previously had no handler → did nothing). **Depends on v3.1** (PageHero/tokens/flourish). Validation: esbuild JSX clean on both; AddCompanyPage+PageHero bundle clean; lucide icons confirmed. DELETE list: none. The Companies list itself is still light — restyled next, together with removing the Leads + Contracts tabs.

- **v3.4 — Full-screen dark pages + tab cleanup (BUILT).** Removes the light gutter around redesigned dark pages and trims the Sales tabs.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/AppLayout.jsx` (REPLACED) — new `fullBleed` prop: when true, the light `p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-7 max-w-[1600px] mx-auto` wrapper is dropped and `<main>` gets a dark bg, so the page fills edge-to-edge. Otherwise unchanged (light padded as before).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/DashboardWithLayout.jsx` (REPLACED) — owns `fullBleed` state, passes it to AppLayout and `onFullBleedChange` to Dashboard.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (REPLACED) — raises full-bleed when a dark page shows (`currentView==='companies' && (openCompanyId || addingCompany)`); extend this condition as more dark pages land. (Also still contains the v3.3 Add-company wiring.)
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/SalesTabs.jsx` (REPLACED) — removed the **Leads** and **Contracts** tabs (folded into the company record). Sales tabs now: Companies · Quotes · Orders · Calendar. The leads/contracts *views* still exist in Dashboard (contracts still reached via the record's "New contract" button); only the tab buttons are gone.
  - Note: the Companies *list* stays light + padded for now (full-bleed only flips on for the dark profile/add pages), so there are no half-dark states. Validation: esbuild JSX clean on all four. DELETE list: none.

- **v3.5 — Company record: missing details + dated next action (BUILT).** `web/client/src/app/src/components/CompanyProfile.jsx` (REPLACED). Adds the company's own contact info and a bookable next action that were missing:
  - **Company details** (telephone / email / website) now shown at the **top of the People box** (owner's chosen placement), each with an icon; website is a click-through link. A pencil toggles inline edit → saves via `PUT /api/contacts/:id` (`phone`/`email`/`website`; website auto-prefixed `https://`). Confirmed the PUT persists these fields (`contactSchema.partial()`).
  - **Next action + chase date** in the control strip: short note (e.g. "call back") + date, **overdue chase dates shown in red**. Saves to `crm.nextAction` / `crm.chaseDate` (so they're available to the Companies list too). A **Book in calendar** button posts a `follow_up` to `/api/crm-events` for the chase date (lands on the CRM calendar + timeline).
  - All prior record behaviour unchanged; `Globe` icon added (confirmed in lucide 0.510). Validation: esbuild JSX + full PageHero bundle clean. DELETE list: none.
  - Still open for the Companies **list**: build Manus's pipeline (kanban) view as drawn + a List view (table) carrying telephone/email/contact/next-action+chase-date/monthly value — keep Manus's design, don't redesign.

- **v3.6 — Sales group went dark together (BUILT).** Companies pipeline + list, Quotes and Orders all flipped to the dark redesign in one batch so the shared chrome flips once; Leads + Contracts (which share the chrome) deliberately left light and untouched. **A feature inventory of each old screen was taken first and re-verified on the new ones** (the previous session had dropped features — this batch's whole point was zero loss).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/SalesPageLayout.jsx` (REPLACED) — added an **opt-in `dark`** prop threaded through the shell + all five building blocks (`SalesSearch`/`SalesPrimaryButton`/`SalesSecondaryButton`/`SalesAllPill`/`SalesFilterPill`), plus a **`bare`** prop (skips the bordered shell, for the kanban). Default path is byte-for-byte the old light look, so **Leads + Contracts are unchanged**. Dark primary button = amber `#f59e0b` (Manus accent).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/SalesTabs.jsx` (REPLACED) — added a `dark` prop (dark bar + amber active underline). Calendar tab passes `dark=false` so its light bar sits over the still-light calendar — no half-dark state.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/CompanyPipelineList.jsx` (REPLACED) — rebuilt to Manus's design: **Pipeline** (4 stage columns of cards: name, owner avatar+name, source pill, "x ago" — "Active x ago" for customers — and a working ⋯ menu = Open / Move stage, with per-column **+ Add company**) and **List** (dark table: Company [name+stage+owner] · Telephone · Email · Contact · Next action + chase date [**overdue red**] · Monthly value). List/Pipeline toggle; search (name/contact/manager/email/phone); **All-sources** dropdown filter; stage filter pills in list view; **CSV Import preserved**; Add company preserved; row→open profile preserved. **Stage moves re-send the FULL `crm` object** with only `salesStage` changed (the contacts PUT replaces `crm` wholesale) so nothing else is lost. Data unchanged: `GET /api/contacts?type=company`, `PUT /api/contacts/:id`. Monthly value = `crm.totalProfit`; next action = `crm.nextAction`/`crm.chaseDate` (falls back to the older `crm.nextCRMEvent`); activity time = `updatedAt`.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/SalesQuotes.jsx` (REPLACED) — **dark reskin only.** Same IDYQ-vs-native branching, same read-only IDYQ view (search/line-item expand/act-on-quote untouched), same native search + status filters + Create quote + row→edit + columns. Dark status-pill palette.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/OrdersList.jsx` (REPLACED) — **dark reskin only.** Same load, same "new order for company" entry (`initialNewCompanyId`/`onConsumeInitial`), same search + status filters + New order + row→OrderForm + Company/Salesperson/Value/Profit columns. Dark status-pill palette.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (REPLACED) — full-bleed now raises for `companies`/`quotes`/`orders` (any sub-state) and `SalesTabs` gets `dark` for those three. Everything else unchanged (still contains the v3.3–v3.4 wiring).
  - Validation: `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on all six; full **bundle** of the Sales group (with stubbed neighbours) resolves all imports + named exports; 12 lucide icons (Upload, MoreHorizontal, Clock, List, Columns3, Phone, Mail, ChevronDown, ChevronRight, Lock, Search, Plus) confirmed in 0.510; `/api/contacts`, `/api/quotes`, `/api/orders` mounts confirmed. DELETE list: none.
  - Still open: the **Calendar** tab body is still light (CRMCalendar not yet redesigned); next groups = Workspace, Delivery, Finance, Settings, Account, plus the sidebar 3-state + mobile.

- **v3.7 — Workspace group started: My Tasks · Approvals · My Pay went dark (BUILT).** Three of the four Workspace screens; **My Notes deliberately deferred** (see below). Built from a feature inventory of each old screen; zero feature loss.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/MyTasks.jsx` (REPLACED) — rebuilt to Manus's dark table. Columns checkbox · Task name · Company · Due date (overdue red) · Priority · **Status** · Owner(avatar). Time tabs **All / Today / This Week / Overdue**; an **"All tasks" status dropdown** (All / To do / Completed) that restores the old Completed view; an **Overdue** group under All; the all-caught-up empty state. Status is **derived** from the real `open`/`done` model (Done / Overdue / To do) — no invented "in progress". Preserved: `GET /api/tasks?mine=1`, the **Add-task form** (company/assignee/due/priority → `POST /api/tasks`, loads `/api/contacts?type=company` + `/api/tickets/users/list`), tick-to-complete (`PUT /api/tasks/:id`), priority pills, company/assignee/due, loading/error states.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/OrderQueues.jsx` (REPLACED, this is the **Approvals** screen) — reskinned to Manus's dark **card** style (left accent bar, type pill, requester avatar, amber **Approve** / red **Reject**). The mockup shows expense/leave/quote approvals but the app's real approvals are **order-based**, so the three real queues were kept exactly: **Approval** (Approve/Reject + the comment field → `/api/orders/:id/approve|reject`), **Purchasing** (Mark ordered → `/purchase`), **Fulfilment** (Mark invoiced → `/invoice`, Mark paid → `/pay`), manager-only 403 handling, and the "paid releases commission" note. Nothing invented.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/MyPay.jsx` (REPLACED) — dark wrapper; **role gating intact** (salesman → Commission only, engineer → Wage only, others → both). Manus's My Pay extras (earnings summary, YTD cards, payslip PDFs, next-payment) **not faked** — they need backend and are deferred.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/BonusScreen.jsx` (REPLACED) — dark reskin of the commission view. Same `/api/commission/me?offset=` data, period nav, threshold progress, breakdown, history. Nothing hardcoded.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/EngineerWage.jsx` (REPLACED) — dark reskin of the wage view. Same `/api/engineer-wage/me` data; still **never shows profit/commission**.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (REPLACED) — full-bleed now also raises for `my-tasks`/`order-queues`/`my-pay` (on top of the v3.6 Sales views). Note: legacy `my-commission`/`my-wage` views (not in the sidebar) render `BonusScreen`/`EngineerWage` directly and aren't full-bleed; they're unreachable from nav so this is cosmetic only.
  - **DEFERRED — My Notes (`PersonalNotes.jsx`).** Manus's My Notes is a two-pane editor with **categories + rich-text + search**; the data model has none of those, and building it as drawn would DELETE real features: due-date reminders + overdue banner, complete toggle, pin, **create-ticket-from-note**, **add-note-to-ticket** (both modals), and **voice dictation** (`DictationButton`). Do it as its own turn: either reskin-in-place (keep every feature, dark theme) or add backend for categories/rich-text first. Owner decision needed.
  - Validation: `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on all 6; full **bundle** of the Workspace group (with stubbed `AuthProvider`) resolves all imports/exports; 17 lucide icons confirmed in 0.510; `/api/tasks`, `/api/orders`, `/api/commission`, `/api/engineer-wage` mounts confirmed. DELETE list: none.

- **v3.8 — My Notes went dark + the "features must work" rule (BUILT).** Finishes the Workspace group.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/PersonalNotes.jsx` (REPLACED) — **dark reskin in place; ALL behaviour kept byte-for-byte** (only styling tokens + classNames changed) so a colour change can't break a flow. Preserved: notes list, Active/Pinned/Reminders/Completed tabs, overdue banner, complete toggle, pin, inline edit (NoteForm), delete (confirm), **create-ticket-from-note** modal (`POST /api/tickets`), **add-note-to-ticket** modal (`GET /api/tickets` + `POST /api/tickets/:id/comments`), **voice dictation**, and the `worktrackr:personal-note-created` refresh listener. Manus's two-pane/category/rich-text editor was NOT built — it has no backing data model and would drop the features above (kept as a future option needing categories + rich-text storage).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/DictationButton.jsx` (REPLACED) — added an opt-in `dark` prop (light default unchanged, so **CompanyNotes is untouched**). Web Speech API only; no server call.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (REPLACED) — full-bleed now also raises for `my-notes`.
  - Flow verification (new standing rule): confirmed all endpoints mounted in `web/server.js` and field/response shapes match the UI — `/api/notes/personal` GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE (accepts title/body/pinned/due_date/completed), `/api/tickets` POST + GET, `/api/tickets/:id/comments` POST. No broken flows found on this screen.
  - Validation: `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean (PersonalNotes, DictationButton, Dashboard); bundle of PersonalNotes + DictationButton resolves; 16 lucide icons confirmed in 0.510 (incl. `TicketIcon` alias). DELETE list: none.

- **v3.9 — Delivery group started: PROJECTS (list + detail) went dark (BUILT).** Delivery is 3 sub-pieces (Tickets, Projects, Calendar); Projects done this turn, Calendar + Tickets to follow (each its own turn — Tickets is the biggest/most critical screen in the app and is woven into Dashboard).
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/JobsList.jsx` (REPLACED) — rebuilt to Manus's dark **card grid** (`batch_b/projects_list`). Cards: company/contact avatar, contact name, title, status pill, single assignee avatar, due date (scheduledEnd→"Due", else scheduledStart→"Starts"; overdue red), project number; a dashed "New project" card. Header search + full six-status dropdown; quick tabs All/Active/On hold/Completed (drive the same `statusFilter`); a **sort dropdown** (preserves the old column sort: newest/title/scheduled/number/assignee); a stat strip (In progress / On hold / **Overdue** computed from `scheduledEnd` / Completed). Create + open-project + loading/error/empty + "showing X of Y" preserved. Data: `GET /api/jobs`. **No faked progress bars or assignee stacks** — the model has a single `assignedToName` and no progress field.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/JobDetail.jsx` (REPLACED) — **dark reskin in place; logic byte-for-byte** (scripted colour-token swap only). Manus's project_detail (Tasks/Team/Milestones/Files) was NOT built — the real screen is a field-service job, so its real features were kept: Overview, **time entries** (add/delete, `/api/jobs/:id/time-entries`), **parts/materials** (add/delete, `/api/jobs/:id/parts`), status workflow (`PATCH /api/jobs/:id`), **convert-to-invoice** (`POST /api/invoices`), edit, delete (`DELETE /api/jobs/:id`). Added page padding + amber-button dark-text fix.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/JobDetailWithLayout.jsx` (REPLACED) — passes `fullBleed` to AppLayout so the dark detail goes edge-to-edge.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (REPLACED) — full-bleed now also raises for `jobs`.
  - Flow verification: `GET /api/jobs` mounted; client routes `jobs/new`, `jobs/:id`, `jobs/:id/edit` exist; JobDetail's 11 fetches + all actions confirmed present and unchanged after the reskin. No broken flows found.
  - Validation: `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean on all 4; bundle of JobsList + JobDetail (router stub) resolves; 18 lucide icons confirmed in 0.510. DELETE list: none.

- **v4.2 — DIRECTION CHANGE: frontend redesign handed to Manus AI; docs prepped for a fresh session; repo-cleanup script added (NO app code changed).**
  - The owner decided the page-by-page reskin was too slow and not matching Manus's "wow factor", so the **whole frontend visual redesign is being handed to Manus AI**, with the glowing Concept-3 hero header required on **every page's top bar** (not just the company record).
  - **`docs/MANUS_FRONTEND_REDESIGN_PROMPT.md` (NEW)** — the comprehensive brief given to Manus: app purpose + stack + exact frontend paths; the hero-header spec (dark `#1a1a2e`, amber `#f59e0b`, lit outline, deep inner glow, flourish asset, icon/title/status/meta/actions — reuse/extend `PageHero.jsx` as a shared header on every page); the `--wt-*` tokens; the per-page list; **hard guardrails** (preserve all functionality, change presentation only, keep every endpoint/field, no hardcoded money, respect role-gating, don't invent data) and an explicit list of the **mockup-vs-reality divergences** (no fake progress/payslips/milestones; project detail is field-service; Approvals is order workflow; My Notes is plain; My Tasks is open/done; crm-object replace; `new`→"Suspect"); build/deliverable expectations and a self-check acceptance checklist.
  - **`cleanup-design-reference.ps1` (NEW, repo root)** — PowerShell script to remove the **~124 MB of Manus reference images** in `docs/design/` (52 PNG/WebP files across `assets/` + `batch_a..f`). Scoped to `docs/design/` only; **never touches** the live in-app asset `web/client/src/app/src/assets/wriggly_flourish.*`. Shows the plan + size and asks for confirmation (`-Force` to skip; `-All` to also remove the small design `.md` docs / the whole folder). **Intended to run AFTER Manus's redesign is integrated** (Manus needs the images as reference).
  - §15 got a prominent **"DIRECTION CHANGE / START HERE"** banner so a fresh chat picks up correctly: the next job is to **integrate + verify Manus's redesigned frontend** (build clean, every feature/flow preserved, guardrails held), report to the owner, then run the cleanup script. The old page-by-page "NEXT" lines are now superseded (kept for context).
  - **No application code changed in v4.2** — docs + the prompt + the cleanup script only.

- **v4.1 — Company hero glow turned up (BUILT).** `web/client/src/app/src/components/PageHero.jsx` (REPLACED) — the gradient/glow was much weaker than Manus's render. Upgraded the box styling only (no logic/markup change): a **lit amber outline** (crisp rim + outer bloom + a bright "shining" top edge via inset highlight + a deep inner glow via inset), and a **deeper inner gradient** (hot amber core on the left at 0.42, softer second glow on the right, over a subtle vertical base). Flourish opacity 0.6 → 0.72. Affects the two screens that use PageHero — the **company record** and the **add-company** page. (NOTE: Manus drew the glowing hero only on the company record; the list screens stay flat dark by Manus's own design. Extending the hero header to list screens is a separate, opt-in choice if the owner wants more flair app-wide.)

- **v4.0 — Delivery Calendar went dark; Sales Calendar tab seam closed (BUILT).**
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/CRMCalendar.jsx` (REPLACED) — **dark reskin in place via scripted colour-token swap; logic byte-for-byte** (all 11 flows untouched). Endpoints: `/api/calendar/events`, `/api/contacts`, `/api/crm-events` (+ `/:id`), `/api/jobs`, `/api/summaries/crm-event/:id` — all confirmed mounted. Event-type pills (call/meeting/follow_up/renewal/job/ticket/schedule) re-coloured to dark translucent; the 6 shadcn `Select` triggers + content panels given dark overrides (they default to the light theme); today-cell circle + 7 amber buttons fixed to dark text on amber; cleaned up two pre-existing `rgba()`-with-`/opacity` classes that the swap exposed; added page padding + dark bg to the root. Month grid, AI suggestion box, event modals, source toggles all preserved.
  - `web/client/src/app/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (REPLACED) — full-bleed now also raises for `calendar`/`sales-calendar`/`crm-calendar`; `SalesTabs` now gets `dark` for `sales-calendar` too, so the Sales **Calendar** tab bar is dark over the dark calendar. **The half-dark seam open since v3.6 is gone — the Sales group is now fully dark.**
  - Note: `IntegratedCalendar.jsx` (792 lines) is a separate, currently-unwired calendar — intentionally not touched.
  - Validation: `esbuild --jsx=automatic` clean (CRMCalendar, Dashboard); 11 fetches + all endpoints intact after the reskin; no light tokens remain; 19 lucide icons confirmed in 0.510. DELETE list: none.
  - Still open in Delivery: **Tickets** (the biggest screen — list inline in Dashboard + `TicketsTableView` + `TicketDetailViewTabbed` + modals).
