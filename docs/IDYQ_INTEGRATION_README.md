# IdoYourQuotes (IDYQ) Integration — WorkTrackr side

Read-only, server-to-server pull of IDYQ's **catalogue** and **quotes** into
WorkTrackr. Per-account opt-in: OFF by default, turned on with a "Connect
IdoYourQuotes" switch. When ON, the Product Catalog and Quotes tabs become
read-only windows fed from IDYQ; WorkTrackr's own catalogue/quote editing is
switched off and Quote Templates is hidden (frontend phase). Nothing is ever
written back to IDYQ.

## What was added (backend phase)

- `web/migrations/create_idyq_integration_tables.sql` — mirror tables, the
  connection toggle, the incremental cursor, and the WorkTrackr-only link layer.
  Runs automatically on next deploy (web server runs pending migrations on start).
- `shared/idyq/idyqClient.js` — signs every request (HMAC) and calls IDYQ.
- `shared/idyq/idyqSync.js` — catalogue sync + quotes pull, idempotent upserts,
  pagination, incremental `?since` cursor.
- `shared/idyq/index.js` — re-exports the above.
- `web/routes/idyq.js` — mounted at `/api/idyq`: connection toggle, on-demand
  sync, read endpoints the tabs render, and quote→contact linking.
- `worker/worker.js` — a scheduled `idyq-sync` job (every 30 min by default).

## Environment variables (set on BOTH the web service and the worker service)

| Var | Notes |
|---|---|
| `WORKTRACKR_BRIDGE_SECRET` | long random hex; the SAME value on IDYQ; DIFFERENT from Studio's `IDYQ_BRIDGE_SECRET`; never committed |
| `IDYQ_BASE_URL` | defaults to `https://idoyourquotes.com` |
| `IDYQ_BRIDGE_EXPIRY_SECONDS` | optional, default `90` (60–120s window) |
| `IDYQ_SYNC_CRON` | optional, default `*/30 * * * *` |

Generate the secret (Windows terminal):
`node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`

## How it behaves

- **Connect** (CRM Settings → Connect IdoYourQuotes): the admin enters which IDYQ
  org to read from (its **slug or numeric id**); WorkTrackr stores it on the
  connection and sends it as the `X-WT-Org` header on every request, so each
  WorkTrackr org reads its own IDYQ org. Connecting flips the switch on and does a
  first sync so the tabs aren't empty.
- **Scheduled sync** (worker): every 30 min, pulls only what changed since last time
  for every connected account.
- **On-demand**: "Sync now" for catalogue/quotes, or pull a single quote by number.
- **Idempotent**: re-pulling the same data just updates the existing rows
  (keyed on IDYQ's own id). Quote line items are replaced as a set per quote.

## Where the data lands

| IDYQ | WorkTrackr table |
|---|---|
| product | `idyq_products` |
| quote (header + flattened customer) | `idyq_quotes` |
| quote line items | `idyq_quote_lines` |
| (WorkTrackr-only) quote ↔ contact/customer link | `idyq_quotes.linked_contact_id` / `linked_customer_id` |

These are SEPARATE from native `products` / `quotes` so there's no collision and
disconnecting never touches WorkTrackr's own data.

## Endpoints (all under /api/idyq, auth required)

- `GET  /connection` — status for the settings screen
- `POST /connection/connect` / `POST /connection/disconnect`
- `POST /sync/catalogue` — sync now
- `POST /sync/quotes` — sync now (body: `{ since?, status? }`)
- `POST /pull/quote` — by number (body: `{ quote_number }`)
- `GET  /catalogue` — read-only product list for the Catalog tab
- `GET  /quotes` — read-only quote list for the Quotes tab
- `GET  /quotes/:idyqId` — one quote + line items
- `POST /quotes/:idyqId/link` — link a quote to a contact/customer

## Signing + shapes (confirmed against IDYQ)

Matched to IDYQ's existing Studio bridge: sign `"<expiry>.<nonce>.GET.<path>"` (path
only, no query string), lowercase hex, ~90s expiry, header `X-WT-Signature`. IDYQ
returns `{ products|quotes: [...], page, page_size, total, total_pages, has_more }`
for lists and `{ quote: {...} }` for a single quote — which the client already
parses.

## Per-org scoping (no server-wide account setting)

WorkTrackr sends `X-WT-Org: <idyq-org-slug-or-id>` with every request; IDYQ scopes
the response to that org. The value is stored per WorkTrackr org in
`idyq_connection.idyq_org_ref` (set at connect time). Migration
`idyq_add_org_ref.sql` adds that column to existing databases.

SECURITY: any holder of `WORKTRACKR_BRIDGE_SECRET` can request any org via
`X-WT-Org`. Fine while WorkTrackr's backend is the only secret-holder; before
onboarding third-party customers, add an allow-list of permitted org refs on the
IDYQ side.

## Still to do (frontend phase)

Wire the CRM page so that when `GET /api/idyq/connection` reports `enabled: true`:
the Product Catalog and Quotes tabs render from `/api/idyq/...` in read-only mode
(no add/edit/delete), Quote Templates is hidden, and a "Connect/Disconnect" control
plus "Sync now" lives in CRM Settings. (Needs a read of the CRM component first.)

## Update — 2026-06-17 (post-launch)

Built & deployed since the original write-up:

- **Catalogue is now a LIVE read-through.** `GET /api/idyq/catalogue` fetches straight from IDYQ on every load (all pages, `fetchCatalogueLive`), so adds/edits/deletes show immediately. Falls back to the `idyq_products` mirror if IDYQ is unreachable (`live:false, stale:true`). The 30-min worker sync still runs to keep the mirror warm.
- **Profit fields carried across:** `unit`, `cost_price` (buy-in ex-VAT), `install_hours`, `pricing_type` — in the bridge `mapProduct`, the `idyq_products` table (`idyq_catalogue_fields.sql`), the sync upsert and the read API. These feed the per-company "services & monthly profit" view that drives commission.
- **Collapsible category grouping** in `IdyqCatalogView` (Expand/Collapse all, search, Refresh, live indicator). Category already flows in the feed — no IDYQ change was needed.
- **CRM UI built & deployed** — supersedes the "needs a read of the CRM component first" note above. `IdyqIntegration.jsx` spliced into `CRMDashboard.jsx`; sidebar readability fix in `Sidebar.jsx`.

Full record + the CRM/ordering/commission roadmap that builds on this: `WorkTrackr_CRM_Ordering_Commission_Roadmap_v1.0.md`.
