## Known Bugs / Outstanding Issues

_No known bugs at time of Session 29 close._

## Critical Standing Rules (read every session)

1. **Sub-component rule:** Never define `const Foo = () => ...` inside a parent component's function body. Always module-level or plain render helpers. Root cause of CRM contacts input focus bug and Dashboard re-render bug.
2. **Backend snake_case / frontend camelCase:** Always apply a normaliser (e.g. `mapJob()`, `mapContact()`, `mapInvoice()`) on all response paths.
3. **Zod `.default([])` data-loss:** Only write fields explicitly present in the request body on PUT routes.
4. **AI policy:** All server-side AI = `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` via direct fetch to Anthropic API. Whisper for audio only. No other AI providers.
5. **One phase at a time:** Complete and deliver one phase fully before starting the next.
6. **No logic changes during styling passes.**
